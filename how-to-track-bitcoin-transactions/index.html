Knowing what to look to, it could be possible to perform an investigation of our transactions. Let's see an example of a chain analysis investigation proposed on the <a href="https://osintops.com/blockchain-pat-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">osintops.com</a> blog and performed starting from a <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/3c4c026ce8a285ddc281f78e5f9d00df2c19d627904165696faf8263a6f34761" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">transaction</a> pointed out in <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/how-tos/2019/02/01/tracking-illicit-transactions-with-blockchain-a-guide-featuring-mueller/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this article</a> written by Brenna Smith.</p><p>The transaction, according to <a href="https://www.justice.gov/file/1080281/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this document</a>, was carried out by a group of Russian secret agents and was intended to manipulate the work of the US Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign.</p><p>Performing such analysis there are two main questions that we need to answer:</p><ul><li>where are the bitcoins from?</li><li>where were they sent?</li></ul><p>This approach should allow us to identify not so much who managed the bitcoins but rather who could provide us with some information about it, like exchanges and payment processors. Indeed, even if we know that blockchains do not store personal information, nowadays it is almost essential to interact with online services by performing KYC (<em>know your customer</em>) procedures when handling cryptocurrencies.</p><h3>Where are the bitcoins from?</h3><p>To find an answer to this question we will use one of the many blockchain explorers available: <a href="https://bitcoinwhoswho.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bitcoinwhoswho.com</a>. This service is able to provide additional information about the addresses we are checking (scam reports, links to web pages where they are mentioned, information about the owner, etc.).</p><p>In combination we will use <a href="https://www.walletexplorer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">walletexplorer.com</a>: this service uses algorithms that could associate bitcoin addresses with others to reconstruct a wallet and relate it to known entities such as exchanges, darknet markets, gambling sites, etc.</p><p>The transaction used to start this analysis was disposed by the address 1LQv8aKtQoiY5M5zkaG8RWL7LMwNzVaVqR. Unfortunately, in this case, the analysis of the address via bitcoinwhoswho.com did not provide any additional information.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image001-800x297.png" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image001-800x297.png 800w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image001-300x111.png 300w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image001-768x285.png 768w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image001.png 1152w" alt="" width="800" height="297" data-is-external-image="true"></figure><p>We can also observe that the address was involved in only two transactions, one incoming and one outgoing.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image003-800x130.png" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image003-800x130.png 800w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image003-300x49.png 300w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image003-768x124.png 768w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image003.png 1142w" alt="" width="800" height="130" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure><p>Even <a href="https://www.walletexplorer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">walletexplorer.com</a> is not able to provide us any useful information: the wallet consisting of the address being analyzed alone cannot be connected to any known name, nor is any further bitcoin address aggregated that could be associated with the same user.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image005.png" sizes="(max-width: 712px) 100vw, 712px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image005.png 712w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image005-300x67.png 300w" alt="" width="700" height="157" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure><p>To continue finding an answer to our question, let's take another look at the transactions in which the address 1LQv8aKtQoiY5M5zkaG8RWL7LMwNzVaVqR was involved.</p><p> The incoming transaction, indicated by the green arrow, comes from the address <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/1HF9VgN3AcA5RJd6ZUPnXdETmFbYmikveN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1HF9VgN3AcA5RJd6ZUPnXdETmFbYmikveN</a>.</p><p>This address also made only two transactions of which it is not possible to obtain additional information either via bitcoinwhoswho.com or walletexplorer.com.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image007-800x146.png" sizes="(max-width: 733px) 100vw, 733px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image007-800x146.png 800w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image007-300x55.png 300w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image007.png 1164w" alt="" width="800" height="145" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure><p>So, with the same approach, let's continue to analyze the address that sent bitcoins to the one we are looking to, checking them with bitcoinwhoswho.com and walletexplorer.com.</p><p>Doing so, we will encounter this addresses:</p><ul><li>1Fj4RkrtnnMn5mBtQFW5ZkzEw4vGyCoRe9;</li><li>1KSkbN7JHYxBSoYwuuWuzA4dpZf9TKP6V8;</li><li>1AB99VvWeLtRcEZ6yubX1Cqvcvi4bPH6R6;</li><li>13ZMs871ZBcTTauhXDpRQ6hDaTaPcPVmTY;</li><li>1MS4KRpKakzTEUFzcU9PHCbs2f1u9a1aL4;</li><li>1MYQzejdwhiU83qy4SsLKcm7CwV5XxVFRn;</li><li>1ECFBdcnfhVWcGG6k4p4Pt4J9ciQsK8wEn;</li><li>1GN5ZGGQsgQGQdP5Yc2LAWUKssrLk5YRbc;</li><li><a href="https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/1KgUcHDuWLVzFxVnwp3u5jZw3FmorjG1jD">1KgUcHDuWLVzFxVnwp3u5jZw3FmorjG1jD</a>.</li></ul><p>The last address, unlike what happens with the others, receives bitcoins from four different addresses.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image009-1024x205.png" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image009-1024x205.png 1024w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image009-300x60.png 300w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image009-768x154.png 768w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image009.png 1159w" alt="" width="800" height="160" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure><p>These addresses seem to be involved in an intenser activity.

Looking at the addresses we have encountered by now, we can see that every time there is an outgoing transaction sending coins to two addresses:</p><ul><li>one receiving a larger amount which is gradually carried forward from transaction to transaction;</li><li>one receiving a smaller amount, which often consists of more decimal digits. </li></ul><h4>Peel chains</h4><p>This transactions schema is usually called peel chain. In peel chains, users send bitcoin to an intended destination address, maybe because they are paying something, and receive the remaining part, named change, on a new address that is in their control. This happens because the Bitcoin protocol does not allow to spend any desired amount but only allows to forward amounts that were previously received and have not yet been involved in transactions. These amounts are called UTxOs (unspent transaction outputs).</p><p>Analyzing peel chains can give us two kinds of information:</p><ul><li>we can collect a lot of addresses belonging to the target of our identification;</li><li>we will encounter a lot of payments made by the target of our investigations and, some of them could lead us to new evidence regarding our target.</li></ul><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Concept-Diagram_EN-1.png" sizes="(max-width: 481px) 100vw, 481px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Concept-Diagram_EN-1.png 481w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Concept-Diagram_EN-1-300x115.png 300w" alt="" width="481" height="184" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure><p>The main challenge in this kind of analysis is to determine which address is receiving the change and which one is the recipient of the payment. This can be done by making <a href="https://anubitux.org/clustering-bitcoin-addresses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">considerations</a> on the amounts and the addresses involved. So, we should be able to determine, for any transaction, which address will receive the funds of the target of our investigation and which one is receiving their payment.</p><h4>How to go up the chain of transactions</h4><p>Let's start following the chain from the first address that received the bitcoins purchased from Cex.io. This is the starting point of the peel chain.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image014.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 643px) 100vw, 643px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image014.jpg 643w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image014-300x36.jpg 300w" alt="" width="640" height="77" data-is-external-image="true"></figure><p>In this case, the address that receives 0.8 bitcoin, 1N5hfyuGVZbTR78zXQ22kjUyCwZbgB8yhw, is most likely the actual destination address, while the address that receives 11.04445 bitcoin, 1GN5ZGGQsgQGQdP5Yc2LAWUKssrLk5YR, is the change address.

Therefore, it is good practice in an analysis of any kind, to pay more attention to all those behaviors that “break” the regularity, trying to identify the reasons that could have given rise to the anomaly.</p><p>Let’s immediately start looking at what has been done with the address we are examining.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image003-800x97.png" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image003-800x97.png 800w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image003-300x36.png 300w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image003-768x93.png 768w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image003.png 1159w" alt="" width="800" height="97" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure><p>The address was involved in a single outgoing transaction, in favor of two addresses: 1J8kvixEnAnGDEDwkfqJS246sXdW1mhkvB, which receives 0.99805659 bitcoins, and 1NPgLU4sVj5ww2UZ8DktDSYm7kLJN6sYq1, which receives 1.501685 bitcoins.

The more tools we master, the greater chances we will have of being able to productively analyze any scenario we will encounter.</p><p>Unfortunately, once we arrive at an exchange, it would unlikely share information about its customers with us, unless we can use the powers of the law Enforcement Agencies or of the Judiciary.</p><p> </p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on 7 Nov 2022</p></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://anubitux.org/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://anubitux.org/anubitux-and-python-virtual-environments/" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> AnuBitux and Python virtual environments</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://anubitux.org/create-encrypted-volumes-with-veracrypt/" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Create encrypted volumes with VeraCrypt </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://anubitux.org/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-09-24T23:06" class="feed__date">24 Sep 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://anubitux.org/dust-transactions/">Dust transactions, what are they?</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-08-06T10:58" class="feed__date">6 Aug 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://anubitux.org/clustering-bitcoin-addresses/">Clustering Bitcoin addresses</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-07-08T17:06" class="feed__date">8 Jul 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://anubitux.org/how-to-spend-a-paper-wallet-with-anubitux/">How to spend a Bitcoin paper wallet with AnuBitux </a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p><em>Powered by Publii - website's source available on <a href="https://github.com/ASeriousMister/anubitux.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">github</a></em></p><p><em>Follow us: <span style="color: #236fa1;"><a href="https://t.me/anubitux" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="color: #236fa1;">Telegram</a></span> - <a href="https://twitter.com/anubitux" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #c2e0f4;">Twitter</span></a></em></p><p><a href="https://anubitux.org"><em><span style="color: #c2e0f4;">HOME</span></em></a></p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://anubitux.org/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://anubitux.org/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
