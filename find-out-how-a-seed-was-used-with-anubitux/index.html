It can become very frustrating and time-consuming to check the seeds with many different tools, to find out the right one.</p><p>In this case,  Anu₿itux could help us with <a href="https://github.com/ASeriousMister/SeedCheck.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seedcheck.py</a>, a tool developed by its team.</p><h3>How to use it</h3><p>To run seedcheck.py, simply type it in Anu₿itux's terminal.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/sc1.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc1-xs.png 300w, https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc1-sm.png 480w, https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc1-md.png 768w, https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc1-lg.png 1024w, https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc1-xl.png 1360w, https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc1-2xl.png 1600w" alt="sc1" width="650" height="516"></figure><p>Then the only thing we have to do is answer the prompted questions. First of all, the tool asks us if we want to check online if the addresses derived with the seed we are looking about had some activity. This information is used to determine with what currency the seed was used and which one could be the correct <a href="https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/derivation-paths" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">derivation path</a>. </p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/sc2.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc2-xs.png 300w, https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc2-sm.png 480w, https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc2-md.png 768w, https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc2-lg.png 1024w, https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc2-xl.png 1360w, https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc2-2xl.png 1600w" alt="sc2" width="650" height="523"></figure><p>If we are worried about our privacy, we can ask no to this question and the tool will work completely offline. We could also start the <a href="https://github.com/moonchitta/anonsurf-ubuntu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anonymous proxy</a>, clicking on the provided desktop shortcut and all our network traffic will be routed through TOR.</p><p>Then we have to provide the seed's length, without counting an eventual passphrase as part of it. Don't worry, the tool will ask later for it. Now, we can insert the words composing our seed.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/sc3.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc3-xs.png 300w, https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc3-sm.png 480w, https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc3-md.png 768w, https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc3-lg.png 1024w, https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc3-xl.png 1360w, https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc3-2xl.png 1600w" alt="sc3" width="650" height="519"></figure><p>We can now provide a passphrase, if the seed has one.

The tool will suggest us a maximum of 15 addresses, to avoid overloading the APIs queried during the check, but if we need we can force it to derive as many addresses as we want.</p><p>Now the tool starts its magic, checking if the seed was used with an <a href="https://electrum.org/#home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Electrum</a> wallet, or if it is a <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/tree/master/bip-0039" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BIP39</a> seed used with many different derivation paths to derive Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Dash or ZCash addresses. It is also going to check if the seed was used with <a href="https://samouraiwallet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samourai</a>'s Whirlpool, deriving premix and postmix addresses. The tool also checks if the provided seed is compatible with Monero wallets (like <a href="https://mymonero.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MyMonero</a>, <a href="https://featherwallet.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Feather wallet</a> or <a href="https://www.getmonero.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monero wallet</a>).</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/sc6-2.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc6-2-xs.png 300w, https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc6-2-sm.png 480w, https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc6-2-md.png 768w, https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc6-2-lg.png 1024w, https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc6-2-xl.png 1360w, https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc6-2-2xl.png 1600w" alt="" width="650" height="513"></figure><p>As we can see, the tool was able to determinate that the tool was used with Electrum, because the addresses derived with Electrum's algorithms had some activity.</p><p>The tool also find out that the seed could have been derived from a BIP39 wordlist, and checks it with many different coins.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/sc7.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc7-xs.png 300w, https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc7-sm.png 480w, https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc7-md.png 768w, https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc7-lg.png 1024w, https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc7-xl.png 1360w, https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc7-2xl.png 1600w" alt="sc7" width="650" height="513"></figure><p>But, in this case, the tool did not find any valid derivation path because no one of the derived addesses was involved in any transaction.</p><p>The tool also works with Monero seeds.

To check if it had some activity, simply open Feather wallet, which is also available in the Anu₿itux wallets menu, and use it to restore a wallet providing this seed.</p><h3>Final thoughts</h3><p>Of course, this tool does not do a full check, because the seed could have been used with other coins or with custom derivation paths or with some other proprietary algorithm, but it is a great help to rapidly do a lot of checks. If it gives us a positive result, we can be sure that the seed was used but, if it gives us a negative result, to be completely sure the seed was never used we should try it with as many tools as we can.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on 10 Aug 2022</p></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://anubitux.org/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://anubitux.org/recover-access-to-a-wallet-file-with-anubitux/" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Recover access to a wallet file with Anu₿itux</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://anubitux.org/how-to-find-lost-private-keys-with-anubitux/" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> How to find lost private keys with Anu₿itux </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://anubitux.org/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-07-01T19:18" class="feed__date">1 Jul 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://anubitux.org/enable-network-monitor-in-anubitux/">Enable network monitor in Anu₿itux</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-07-01T19:02" class="feed__date">1 Jul 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://anubitux.org/how-to-create-a-paper-wallet-with-anubitux/">How to create a paper wallet with Anu₿itux</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-06-30T12:22" class="feed__date">30 Jun 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://anubitux.org/how-to-use-anubitux/">How to use Anu₿itux</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p><em>Powered by Publii - website's source available on <a href="https://github.com/ASeriousMister/anubitux.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">github</a></em></p><p><em>Follow us: <span style="color: #236fa1;"><a href="https://t.me/anubitux" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="color: #236fa1;">Telegram</a></span> - <a href="https://twitter.com/anubitux" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #c2e0f4;">Twitter</span></a></em></p><p><a href="https://anubitux.org"><em><span style="color: #c2e0f4;">HOME</span></em></a></p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://anubitux.org/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
