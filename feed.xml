                    <p><img src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/Golde_Eye.png" class="type:primaryImage" alt="" /></p>
                <p>Let's hypothesize we arranged our super secure cold storage to "hodl" cryptos until they get to the moon, maybe using one of our tools like <a href="https://anubitux.org/how-to-generate-random-paper-wallets-with-anubitux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dicetracker</a> or <a href="https://anubitux.org/how-to-generate-a-mnemonic-seed-with-anubitux-and-a-dice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dice2seed</a>! It could be very useful to be able to monitor our addresses, not only to see how we are getting to the moon but also to be sure that our funds are safe and our cold storage is working properly. To do that, of course, we could take note of our public addresses and check them periodically on some block explorer. We can find a lot of them in Firefox's bookmarks in Anu₿itux. To perform this task in a better way, we could arrange a view-only wallet, a wallet that is only able to see what's going on with our addresses but does not know our private keys so that it will be unable to sign transactions and spend our funds.</p>
<p class="msg msg--warning"><strong>Never send or request funds to addresses that are in our view-only wallets if we are not sure to be able to access the corresponding private keys!</strong></p>
<h3>Bitcoin watching-only wallet</h3>
<p>With Bitcoin addresses, one of the best tools to arrange a watching-only wallet is <a href="https://electrum.org/#home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Electrum</a>. We could arrange it using public addresses or master public keys, depending on how we created our cold storage.</p>
<p class="msg msg--info">OPSEC TIP: wallets like the ones proposed in this post are called SPV wallets. They use other's nodes to check our balances. If available, we should set up our clients to connect only to trusted nodes (we will discuss it in further posts, keep following us).</p>
<h4>Public addresses</h4>
<p>In the first case, let's hypothesize we took note of our public addresses and would like to monitor them comfortably through Electrum. To do that let's start Electrum from the Wallets menu in Anu₿itux and create a new wallet, selecting the "Import Bitcoin addresses or private keys" option.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/Selection_086.png" alt="" width="600" height="425" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_086-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_086-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_086-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_086-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_086-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_086-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>In the next step, we can type or paste our public addresses in the proper box.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/Selection_087.png" alt="" width="600" height="431" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_087-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_087-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_087-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_087-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_087-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_087-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Now, clicking on next, we can provide a password and then we will have our watching-only wallet.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/Selection_088.png" alt="" width="600" height="404" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_088-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_088-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_088-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_088-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_088-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_088-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<h4>Electrum Master Public Key</h4>
<p>If we created our seed using Electrum, maybe using the advanced feature to obtain a <a href="https://anubitux.org/how-to-generate-24-words-mnemonic-seeds-with-electrum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">24 words mnemonic seed phrase</a>, we could obtain our master public key and use it to set up a new watching-only wallet. Using master keys allows us to create hierarchical deterministic (HD) watching-only wallets. With this kind of wallet, we are able to obtain all the same addresses that we could obtain in our main wallet, related to our mnemonic seed. It could also be very useful if we want to be able to receive transactions on many different public addresses, obtaining them without the need to access our cold storage and keep our private keys safe.</p>
<p>To obtain our master public key, we only have to go to the Wallet menu and click on Information.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/Selection_089.png" alt="" width="350" height="313" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_089-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_089-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_089-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_089-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_089-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_089-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>In the next window we will see a lot of information about our wallet, like our Master Public Key.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/Selection_090.png" alt="" width="800" height="515" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_090-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_090-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_090-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_090-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_090-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_090-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Let's take note of it and let's create a new Standard wallet.</p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight  msg--info">OPSEC TIP: It could be a good idea to access our wallet only in Anu₿itux live and offline, extract our Master Public Key and use it to create our watching-only wallet in a separate working environment that we will connect to the Internet.</p>
<p>In the second step of the creation wizard, we have to choose the "Use a Master Key" option.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/Selection_091.png" alt="" width="600" height="428" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_091-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_091-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_091-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_091-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_091-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_091-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Now we only have to type or paste the Master Public Key and we have set up our watch-only wallet. </p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/Selection_092.png" alt="" width="600" height="434" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_092-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_092-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_092-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_092-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_092-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_092-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>As we can see in the following screenshot, we obtained the same addresses in both wallets, with the difference that only one of them would be able to spend the funds we could receive.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/Selection_093.png" alt="" width="1000" height="379" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_093-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_093-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_093-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_093-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_093-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_093-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<h4>Master Public Key</h4>
<p>Let's now hypothesize we want to create a watch-only wallet related to a BIP39 seed. To obtain the Master Public Key we could import our BIP39 seed creating a new Electrum wallet, taking care to specify the right derivation path, and obtain it with the same steps we have seen above, or we could use the <a href="https://github.com/iancoleman/bip39" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ian Coleman BIP39 tool</a>.</p>
<p>Typing the seed in the proper box and selecting the desired derivation path, we will obtain the addresses and the private keys that could be derived from that seed and also many master keys. We are interested in the one named "Account Extended Public Key".</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/Selection_094.png" alt="" width="1000" height="655" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_094-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_094-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_094-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_094-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_094-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_094-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Do not use the "BIP32 Extended Public Key" since it will show different addresses and sending transactions to them could give us some trouble accessing our funds (do not worry, it can be done with the "BIP32 Extended Private Key").</p>
<p>To confirm that the Master Public Key we have chosen is the right one, we can compare the obtained addresses.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/Selection_095.png" alt="" width="800" height="447" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_095-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_095-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_095-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_095-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_095-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_095-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<h3>Monero view-only wallet</h3>
<p>As stated in <a href="https://anubitux.org/how-to-spend-a-monero-paper-wallet-with-anubitux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">other posts</a>, Monero works with two kinds of private keys, a private spend key to sign transactions and a private view key to view information about our addresses since with Monero we can't check information about public addresses as we are used to do with Bitcoin and other cryptos. The private view key is the one we are going to use to set up our watch-only wallets.</p>
<p>For the following examples we are going to use a Monero Paper Wallet generated with our tool <a href="https://anubitux.org/how-to-generate-random-paper-wallets-with-anubitux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dicetracker</a>.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/Selection_106.png" alt="" width="550" height="628" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_106-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_106-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_106-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_106-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_106-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_106-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<h4>Feather wallet</h4>
<p>To set up a watch-only wallet with <a href="https://featherwallet.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Feather Wallet</a>, we have to start the wallet creation wizard and select the "Restore wallet from keys" option.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/Selection_096.png" alt="" width="575" height="576" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_096-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_096-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_096-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_096-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_096-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_096-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>In the next step we have to provide the Primary address and the Secret view Key. The tool itself gives us the tip to not insert the Secret spend key if we are creating a view-only wallet.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/Selection_097.png" alt="" width="575" height="581" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_097-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_097-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_097-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_097-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_097-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_097-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Now we only have to provide the wallet creation date and a password and our watch-only wallet is ready. If we are not sure about the wallet creation date, we can provide a date we are sure is earlier than it, unless so the wallet could not scan some blocks including transactions that we could be interested in.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/Selection_098.png" alt="" width="1000" height="532" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_098-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_098-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_098-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_098-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_098-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_098-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<h4>Monero CLI</h4>
<p>To create a view-only wallet using the <a href="https://www.getmonero.org/downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monero official</a> command line interface wallet, we have to start it with the <em>--generate-from-view-key</em> option followed by the name we are giving to our watch-only wallet. In Anu₿itux you can type:</p>
<p><code>Tools/AddressGen/monero-x86_64-linux-gnu-v0.18.1.2/monero-wallet-cli --generate-from-view-key wallet_name</code></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/Selection_099.png" alt="" width="900" height="204" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_099-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_099-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_099-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_099-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_099-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_099-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>With commands like <em>balance</em> and <em>wallet_info</em> we can obtain some information about our wallet.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/Selection_100.png" alt="" width="700" height="416" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_100-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_100-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_100-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_100-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_100-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_100-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>And with commands like <em>address all</em> and <em>address new</em> we will obtain addresses we could share to request transactions.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/Selection_101.png" alt="" width="800" height="76" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_101-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_101-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_101-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_101-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_101-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_101-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<h3>Ethereum view-only wallet</h3>
<p>To obtain a view-only wallet with Ethereum we could use <a href="https://mycrypto.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MyCrypto</a>, which can be started from the Anu₿itux Wallets menu, and a public address we obtained previously with any desired method.</p>
<p>To obtain our view-only wallet, we only have to start MyCrypto, click on the "View &amp; Send" button on the left of the screen and then click on the </p>

<p>Now we only have to type or paste our address and our view-only wallet is ready to be used.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/Selection_104.png" alt="" width="500" height="301" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_104-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_104-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_104-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_104-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_104-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_104-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>In this way we can easily monitor our Ethereum account, even for token transactions, without exposing our private keys or our mnemonic seeds.</p>

<h3>Final thoughts</h3>
<p>Using view-only wallets allows us to manage and monitor our addresses without exposing our private keys unless we need to dispose transactions. It is a very useful feature of many software wallets that we should consider if we are not doing transactions on a regular basis. We only have to remember that obtaining master public keys implies that we are handling our private keys or our seed and this operation has to be done very carefully, to avoid any risk concerning the safety of our funds.</p>

                    <p><img src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/steganography.png" class="type:primaryImage" alt="" /></p>
                <p class="msg msg--warning">The ideas presented in this post and in other similar posts on this website have to be considered only like suggestions. Users should adopt the strategies that better fit their threat model and their needs.</p>
<p>Hiding a mnemonic seed is something about everyone has his theories but no one is able to provide the correct solution. We believe that there is no universal solution, but only a lot of different solutions that fit the needs of one user or another.</p>
<p>A good strategy could be to hide our mnemonic seed with steganography. For those who do not know what it is, steganography is the practice of representing a piece of information within another object in a way that could not be easily seen by others. So we could try to hide our mnemonic seed in another file, like a picture or a video. Let's see how we could do it with Anu₿itux.</p>
<h3>The procedure</h3>
<p class="msg msg--highlight "><strong>To safeguard the security of this process, we kindly suggest following all these steps using Anu₿itux live without connecting it to the internet and disabling all the network interfaces with the proper desktop shortcut.</strong></p>
<p>First of all, we need a mnemonic seed to hide. We could obtain it with dice rolls using our tool <a href="https://anubitux.org/how-to-generate-a-mnemonic-seed-with-anubitux-and-a-dice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dice2Seed</a>, or we could obtain it with <a href="https://anubitux.org/how-to-generate-24-words-mnemonic-seeds-with-electrum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Electrum</a> wallet, or with any other tool we think is the best for our needs.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/Selection_075.png" alt="mnemonic" width="900" height="526" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_075-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_075-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_075-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_075-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_075-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_075-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Now we can store it in a text file, since we are assuming we are working in a live and offline environment, in most cases this should imply no risks. We can use this command to easily do that</p>
<p class="align-center"><code>echo 'your words here' &gt; Documents/mnemonic</code></p>
<p>Now we can choose a file to hide our mnemonic seed in. In this case, we are using a copy of the Anu₿itux wallpaper. </p>
<p class="msg msg--warning">It is recommended to do this procedure on a copy of your files, to avoid corrupting or losing them if something goes wrong during the process.</p>
<p>To hide our mnemonic, we are going to use ZuluCrypt. We can find its GUI in the Anu₿itux encryption menu. The required feature, "Encrypted Container Hidden In Video/Cover File (Steganography)" can be found in the "Create" menu. </p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/Selection_076.png" alt="zuluc" width="800" height="461" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_076-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_076-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_076-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_076-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_076-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_076-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Clicking on it we have to provide the file we want to use to hide our information, a password to unlock it and the desired size.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/Selection_077.png" alt="zulus" width="650" height="377" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_077-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_077-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_077-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_077-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_077-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_077-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>In this case, a size of 1 MB will be enough: if we are going to associate a big container with our picture, it would have a very big size that could look suspicious and attract undesired attention.</p>
<p>We also absolutely need to take care of the "Volume Offset" value, because we will need it every time we are going to unlock the container. It is calculated by the tool and indicates where it should look for the container to unlock.</p>
<p>Now we only have to click the "Create" button and our secret container is ready to be mounted. Before doing that, let's take a look at the size of the file we used to hide the container in.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/Selection_078.png" alt="filesize" width="550" height="166" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_078-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_078-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_078-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_078-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_078-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_078-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>As we can see, the file we used for the procedure, even if it looks identical to the original one, has a bigger size of about 1.4 MB.</p>
<p>Now, let's access our container to store the mnemonic seed into it. We can do this with ZuluCrypt, using the "Volume Hosted In A File" feature under the "Open" menu. </p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/Selection_079.png" alt="zuluopen" width="750" height="433" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_079-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_079-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_079-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_079-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_079-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_079-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Now we have to:</p>
<ul>
<li>provide the file we used to hide the container;</li>
<li>select "PLAIN dm-crypt" as "Volume Type";</li>
<li>type the Offset value provided by the tool during the creation of the container;</li>
<li>type the password we chose during the creation process;</li>
<li>click on the "Open" button.</li>
</ul>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/Selection_080.png" alt="zuluprovide" width="600" height="317" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_080-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_080-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_080-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_080-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_080-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_080-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>At this point, we can access the container with our file explorer.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/Selection_081.png" alt="zuludolphin" width="750" height="571" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_081-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_081-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_081-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_081-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_081-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_081-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>We are nor ready to copy our mnemonic seed to the container. Since we are working in a live environment, we do not need to delete it.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/Selection_082.png" alt="mnemonic in container" width="750" height="430" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_082-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_082-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_082-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_082-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_082-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_082-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>At this point we can unmount our volume, by right-clicking on it in the ZuluCrypt GUI and selecting the "Unmount" option.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/Selection_083.png" alt="zuluunmount" width="750" height="436" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_083-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_083-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_083-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_083-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_083-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_083-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<h3>How to store our container</h3>
<p>We do not have to forget that we are working in a live environment and, if we shut down the system, our cointainer will be irremediably lost. So, before shutting down our system, we should save it somewhere. We could put it on an encrypted drive or into another encrypted container we have previously created using <a href="https://anubitux.org/create-encrypted-volumes-with-veracrypt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VeraCrypt</a> or some other <a href="https://anubitux.org/anubitux-and-encrypted-storages/">similar solution</a>.</p>
<p>Now, when we are sure our hidden container is in a safe place, we can shut down our system without connecting it to the Internet and also restarting it if we need to perform other operations.</p>
<h3>Final thoughts</h3>
<p>There could be infinite other solutions to safely store our mnemonic seed. This has not to be considered the best way to do this but only a suggestion on how to do that in a creative and secure way.</p>
<p>We also need to remember that more is the security we add to our information, the more it could be difficult for us to recover it if we lose or forget the right credentials.</p>
<p>It is also recommended to have more copies of the file hiding the container since the device we are storing it on could get broken or lost at any time and for many different unpredictable reasons.</p>

                <p>With this article we inaugurate the section "what about cryptos?" in which we will insert a few articles regarding the fundamentals of cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Specifically, let's kick off with this 3-article series, taken entirely from the respective articles published on our Osintops.com project <a href="https://osintops.com/dalle-tavolette-di-cera-alle-curve-ellittiche-prima-parte/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, with which we will take a short journey (certainly not exhaustive) in the history of cryptography from its origins, as they have come down to us through the writings of some historians, passing through the algorithms and methods that have marked a turning point, up to mentioning the elliptical cryptography, from which the Bitcoin protocol drew.</p>
<p>In apologizing to those who have spent countless hours studying these cryptographic algorithms and to the more skilled readers, I want to clarify that this is not intended to be a technical article or intended for experts in the subject. Rather, it is the first step of a journey that will serve to become familiar with some very popular terms and concepts.<br>Perhaps it will help us better understand what is under the hood of some procedures that we now take for granted, which we carry out with mechanical gestures, such as electronic signatures.</p>
<p>The book “ <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Code-Book-Science-Secrecy-Cryptography/dp/0385495323/ref=sr_1_2?crid=3FELF5VGDR3VG&amp;keywords=simon+singh&amp;qid=1669827671&amp;sprefix=simon+sing%2Caps%2C195&amp;sr=8-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography</a>" by Simon Singh was a great source of inspiration for me and a stimulus to delve into these topics. I think it is an exciting starting point for all those who approach this subject, even if only out of pure curiosity.</p>
<p>Men have always had the need to be able to send communications that were understandable only to the people for whom they were intended. At the same time other men tried to understand its meaning, thus starting the perennial competition between inventors and code solvers.</p>
<p>This need for confidentiality in communications reached such a level of importance that it was soon seen fit to create an appropriate branch of science, cryptography. On the other hand, cryptanalysis is the discipline that studies the methods for restoring the plain text, starting from the encrypted message without knowing the key.</p>
<h3>The first methods to hide a message</h3>
<p>In the Bible we can observe one of the oldest ancient cryptographic methods. In the book of Jeremiah, in fact, some words have been replaced by others (Babel has been transcribed with the word Sheshakh) using a monoalphabetic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">substitution cipher</a> called Atbash, in which the first letter of the alphabet is replaced by the last, the second by penultimate and so on, until obtaining an inverted alphabet.</p>

<figcaption >First example of steganography according to Herodotus' account, 480 BC</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Among the first authors to narrate examples of cryptography we find the historian Herodotus who, in his Histories dedicated to the wars between the Greeks and the Persians in the fifth century BC, states that it was the secret writing that saved Greece from Xerxes, king of the Persians. He tells of an episode in which, to get a message to Leonidas (king of the Greeks) who then decreed the victory of the Greeks over the Persians, the wax was scraped off a writing tablet and the message was engraved on the underlying wood, covering the tablet again with wax. This trick turns out to be one of the first examples of steganography known to date, a technique considered the ancestor of cryptography since, as the etymology of the word itself suggests, it serves to cover and not to encode a message (from the Greek steganós = covered and gráphein = to write).</p>
<p>Methods to hide messages were also studied and adopted in the Asian continent. In particular, in China, the message to be transmitted was painted on strips of silk. These strips, rolled up, were covered in wax and ingested by the messenger. Once at its destination, the message was recovered with techniques that I prefer not to imagine. They were probably the first "ovulators", at present famous for transporting another type of goods :-).</p>
<p>Over the following centuries, almost all civilizations have adopted methods and stratagems to conceal and make it difficult to decipher the messages deemed important. This system, albeit very ingenious, had the major limitation of leaving the message unencrypted, even if covered up.</p>
<p>An important step forward in this virtual battlefield was the development of cryptography (from the Greek kryptós = hidden), going from hiding the message by concealing it in the most disparate ways so as not to let it be found by anyone who was not the recipient, to hiding the meaning of the message, encrypting it with alterations agreed with the recipient, who only had to reverse the procedure, obtaining the original text.<br>Encryption can be done in two ways: by substitution and by transposition.</p>
<p>In substitution cryptography it is necessary to swap each letter of the alphabet with another, shifting the alphabet by a constant number of positions. With this method the position of the letters within the alphabet always remains the standard one, both in the original message and in the one used for encryption.</p>
<p>One of the first and most famous examples of this encryption method was the so-called Caesar Cipher, the use of which by Julius Caesar himself was narrated in his De bello gallico.</p>
<p>Transposition encryption, on the other hand, causes the letters of the original message to swap places with each other, effectively forming an anagram. To increase the security of this method, it should be used on long enough messages.</p>
<p>Ultimately, if in substitution encryption each character of the original message is simply shifted by a predetermined number of positions, always retaining its original place within the alphabet, in transposition encryption each letter represents itself, but is placed in a different position, mixing the letters and thus forming a large anagram of the sentence.</p>
<p>Over the centuries it has been seen that these methods were rather weak, also because of the birth of cryptanalysis, a science born of Arab civilization in the Middle Ages which set itself the goal of interpreting messages without knowing the relative keys.</p>
<p>One of the pioneers of what would later become a real scientific discipline was a scientist of Arab origins (not surprisingly!), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Kindi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Abū Yūsuf Yaʿqūb ibn Isḥāq al-Kindī</a>, known as Al-Kindi. In addition to being a philosopher and having had the merit of importing the thoughts of the great Greek philosophers into the Arab world, he was the first to devise a method which made it possible to decipher a text by analyzing the frequencies of the letters used, laying the foundations for creating frequency analysis cryptanalysis.</p>
<p>All this has led, over time, to the search for increasingly complex methods in order to make the job of deciphering messages more difficult.</p>
<p>The history of cryptography has seen artistic personalities of the caliber of Leon Battista Alberti at its service, who used two cipher alphabets for the first time, or Blaise de Vigenère who, with his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vigenère Table</a>, adopted 26 cipher alphabets, laying the foundations for modern encryption systems.</p>
<p>With the invention of the radio, by Guglielmo Marconi in 1894, people began to think about remote communication and, of course, to apply message encryption techniques, especially in the military sphere. Given the simplicity and speed of communication of texts via radio waves, efforts to create ever more complex encryption methods increased and parallel attempts at decryption intensified.</p>
<p>Since it was above all during the world wars that these coded messages assumed extreme importance, a battle within a battle was created: if on the one hand traditional weapons were used to gain positions in the enemy camp, on the other front the weapons were represented by numbers, spaces and letters. One of the first radio encryption methods was invented by the Germans and was called <a href="https://crypto.interactive-maths.com/adfgvx-cipher.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ADFGVX</a>.</p>
<p>Subsequently, in an attempt to create an inviolable system, an American engineer and mathematician, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Claude Shannon</a>, adapted Vigenère 's system, however introducing the concept of a random key, inserted into a sheet filled with random letters which, with hundreds of other similar sheets, formed a block, an identical copy of which would be used by both the sender and the recipient: hence the name of single- use block cipher (= one-time pad cipher), considered the Holy Grail of cryptography since it was many years an absolutely safe method.</p>

<p>At the end of this brief historical review of cryptographic methods, certainly not exhaustive, we cannot fail to mention the Enigma cipher machine, conceived by the German inventor Scherbius and adopted by the military forces of the Reich. This ingenious device, in the shape of a typewriter, made it possible to type the message (in the clear text) on the keys and to see the encrypted text appear on a viewer which lit up the letters corresponding to the already encrypted message. The main invention of this machine was located inside, where 2 or 3 rotating exchangers were placed which, with each pressure of the keys, rotated by one position thus providing a very high possibility of combinations.</p>
<p>We could imagine a hypothetical operator sitting in front of this cipher machine, pressing the keys on the letters of the keyboard of the Enigma machine reporting the message to be sent (in clear text). After pressing the key, the electrical impulse crossed the rotors following a path defined by the position of the same and returned back thanks to a reflector, always crossing the rotors. Following this path, the impulse illuminated the light of the letter resulting from the encryption on a special viewer, which the operator then proceeded to transcribe. With each further press of the keys the rotors rotated one position at a time (there were 26 for each rotor, at the end of the revolution of the first rotor, the second would move one position and so on) allowing so the operator to use a polyalphabetic substitution cipher. Since this system could also be used to decrypt messages received with the same system, it was essential to position the rotors of the sending and receiving machines in the same position. This was made possible by means of a register of the daily positions of the rotors distributed to all the units used, through which each operator could have adjusted their rotors based on what was reported in the same, it was a sort of daily calendar of the positions to be applied.</p>
<p>It was thanks to the efforts of Polish analysts in the first place and then a brilliant team of English cryptanalysts that the German messages were deciphered.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GCHQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Government School of Codes and Digits</a>, established in Bletchley Park in England, the brightest minds of England were recruited to solve the puzzle called Enigma.</p>

<figcaption >Turing bomb</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The intuition of the young mathematician Alan Turing was decisive in this dispute.</p>
<p>Based on his studies concerning a programmable universal logic machine, called Turing machine, he had a calculator built, called Bomb, which was able to quickly determine the initial positions of the rotors of the Enigma machine, thus allowing the decipherment of the entire message. On the subject, in addition to countless books, ranging from historical accounts to science fiction, we like to point out the beautiful film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Imitation_Game" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Imitation Game</a>.</p>
<p>A few years later, in Bletchley Park, in order to decipher the messages of the German cipher device Lorenz SZ40/42, which represented the evolution of the Enigma machine, the mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Newman#cite_note-frs-3," target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Newman</a>, always starting from Turing's studies on the universal machine, built the Colossus calculator, which was not only decisive in decrypting thousands of messages considered indecipherable at the time, but represents the first example of a programmable computer in the history of information technology, laying the foundations for the creation of modern electronic computers.</p>
<p>These exceptional facts have remained unknown for many years, due to the secrecy imposed by the British government, which forced all the protagonists to absolute secrecy and ordered the destruction of the electronic calculators built.</p>

                    <p><img src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/40/decrypt.png" class="type:primaryImage" alt="" /></p>
                <p>Anu₿itux is a live Linux distribution and it does not store any kind of information about what we do while using it. So, even our wallets are not stored anywhere when we access them They should be stored on some external storage, like paper, USB drives, hard drives, hardware wallets, etc.</p>
<p>Using Anu₿itux to access our main wallets or our cold storages should be done only when we need it so we should not consider a good strategy to access our wallets using seeds or paper wallets on a daily base. A good strategy could be to store most of the funds on cold storages that we keep offline unless we need them and have some funds on hot wallets that we use with clients like Electrum, MyCrypto, Feather, Coinomi, etc. We could have our wallet files on an encrypted USB storage and plug it in when we need to access our funds.</p>
<p>To manage encrypted storages, Anu₿itux integrates <a href="https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Home.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VeraCrypt</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mhogomchungu/zuluCrypt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ZuluCrypt</a> (supporting lots of different encryption standards, like <a href="https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LUKS</a>, VeraCrypt, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/it-it/windows/security/information-protection/bitlocker/bitlocker-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BitLocker</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueCrypt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TrueCrypt</a>).</p>
<p>We described how to use VeraCrypt in a previous <a href="https://anubitux.org/create-encrypted-volumes-with-veracrypt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a>. VeraCrypt is a very powerful tool to manage encrypted volumes that works across almost all the desktop operating systems. So, it is a very valuable option to safely manage our files.</p>
<p>But also ZuluCrypt has a very great potential since it supports a lot of different kinds of encryption standards. So, using it, we could be able to decrypt almost all the containers and the storages we have encrypted with other tools or using other operating systems and access the files we need while using Anu₿itux.</p>
<p>To use ZuluCrypt to access encrypted storages, we simply run its GUI from the Anu₿itux menu, provide the root password (which is set to anubitux when using Anu₿itux live or VM), click on the "Open" menu and choose the option that fits your needs.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/40/Selection_072.png" alt="zulu1" width="750" height="442" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/40/responsive/Selection_072-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/40/responsive/Selection_072-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/40/responsive/Selection_072-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/40/responsive/Selection_072-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/40/responsive/Selection_072-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/40/responsive/Selection_072-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>In the next window, we can select the volume or the container we want to decrypt, choose its format and provide the information to unlock it, like password, PIM, keyfile, etc.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/40/Selection_073.png" alt="zulu2" width="750" height="432" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/40/responsive/Selection_073-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/40/responsive/Selection_073-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/40/responsive/Selection_073-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/40/responsive/Selection_073-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/40/responsive/Selection_073-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/40/responsive/Selection_073-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>At this point we only have to click the "Open" button and, if we provided the correct credentials, we can access the encrypted files we need from our file manager.</p>
<p>When we finished our work, we do not have to forget to dismount the volume. To do it, we simply right click on the volume from ZuluCrypt's GUI and select the "Unmount" option.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/40/Selection_074.png" alt="zulu3" width="750" height="437" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/40/responsive/Selection_074-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/40/responsive/Selection_074-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/40/responsive/Selection_074-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/40/responsive/Selection_074-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/40/responsive/Selection_074-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/40/responsive/Selection_074-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>As we can see in the above picture, ZuluCrypt also supports volumes that were encrypted using LUKS, the encryption standard used by Linux systems, BitLocker, a proprietary encryption standard powered by Microsoft, and TrueCrypt.</p>
<p class="msg msg--warning">TrueCrypt is an old encryption software that should not be used anymore since it contains<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/05/bombshell-truecrypt-advisory-backdoor-hack-hoax-none-of-the-above/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> unfixed security issues</a> that could allow an attacker to access our files even if he does not know the correct password. This feature should only be used to migrate the files we stored in a TrueCrypt volume to a new volume we have encrypted with another encryption method. </p>
<p>This process could easily be done using Anu₿itux live disabling all the connections with the proper desktop shortcut. So we are sure we are not accessing our encrypted files from an unsafe working environment.</p>

                <p>When we use Anu₿itux in its main version, the live one, it doesn't store anything about what we are doing. But, of course, we could need to store some useful information, like wallet files, transactions we want to broadcast, passwords, KeePass files, etc. It could be a good idea to store this kind of information on an external storage, like a hard disk or an USB drive. To avoid sharing any information we want to keep private with some third party, we could think to protect it with encryption. To do that, we can use <a href="https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Home.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VeraCrypt</a>. This tool allows us to encrypt entire volumes or create some encrypted containers and works almost with all the main desktop operating systems.</p>
<p>Let's see how to encrypt an external storage and how to create an encrypted container, to store our sensitive information and safely access them while using Anu₿itux.</p>
<h3>Encrypt an external storage</h3>
<p>Now we are going to see how to encrypt an external storage, like an USB drive.</p>
<p class="msg msg--warning">Note that this procedure is going to erase the content of your device, and is not going to add encryption over it. So, before proceeding make sure you are using a new device or an empty one. Unless so, you could lose your files.</p>
<p class="msg msg--warning">Remember that it is always a good idea to back up more copies of what we are storing on our devices since they could stop working at any time. We should always avoid relying on a single point of failure.</p>
<p>First of all, let's start the Veracrypt tool, which can be found in the Encryption menu and click on the "Create Volume" button.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/Selection_063.png" alt="veracrypt_start" width="600" height="683" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_063-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_063-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_063-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_063-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_063-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_063-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>On the upcoming menu, we have to select "Encrypt a non-system partition/drive". Veracrypt could also be used to encrypt system drives, but it decreases sensibly the performance of your disk, so in these cases consider using system disk encryptions like <a href="https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LUKS</a>, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/it-it/windows/security/information-protection/bitlocker/bitlocker-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BitLocker</a> or <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204837" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FileVault</a>.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/Selection_064.png" alt="veracrypt_select" width="800" height="518" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_064-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_064-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_064-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_064-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_064-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_064-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>In the next step, we can choose the "Standard Volume" option. The "Create <a href="https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Hidden%20Volume.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hidden Volume</a>" option is also available. It can be very useful if we have to set up plausible deniability strategies.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/Selection_065.png" alt="veracrypt_standard" width="800" height="514" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_065-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_065-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_065-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_065-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_065-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_065-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Now we have to select the device we want to encrypt.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/Selection_066.png" alt="veracrypt_device" width="800" height="728" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_066-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_066-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_066-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_066-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_066-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_066-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>in the next step, we can choose the encryption algorithm. We can leave the default settings as they are since they work pretty well unless we have special needs.</p>
<p>Finally, we can choose the password to encrypt our external storage. </p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/Selection_067.png" alt="veracrypt_password" width="800" height="514" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_067-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_067-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_067-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_067-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_067-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_067-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>We can also check the "Use PIM" and the "Use keyfiles" options. The PIM (personal iterations multiplier) is a number that will be used in addition to our password to encrypt the storage and will be necessary to decrypt it. It adds another layer of security to our drive and reduces the chances to unlock it with brute force attacks. When using shorter passwords than 20 characters, PIM's value can't be lower than 485.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/Selection_068.png" alt="PIM" width="800" height="511" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_068-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_068-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_068-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_068-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_068-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_068-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>We could also add a Keyfile, a file that we have to provide when we want to unlock our volume. We should use this feature when we are unlocking our device only from a few computers because it would force us to carry the file with us on an unencrypted storage in any place we will need to unlock our encrypted storage. Also when working with live environments like Anu₿itux, it would force us to retrieve the file from another source any time we need to unlock our device.</p>
<p>In the last step, we can choose the Filesystem of our device. We can also choose to use the "Quick Format" option. It should be used only with new devices because it will not overwrite all the memory portions of them and could allow someone to recover some information that was stored previously. Remember that encrypting big disks could take several hours.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/Selection_069.png" alt="veracrypt_quick" width="800" height="512" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_069-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_069-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_069-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_069-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_069-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_069-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Now, clicking on the next button, Veracrypt will collect entropy from the movements of our mouse and then the formatting process will begin.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/Selection_070.png" alt="veracrypt_entropy" width="800" height="506" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_070-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_070-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_070-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_070-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_070-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_070-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<h3>Create an encrypted volume</h3>
<p>When creating an encrypted volume, the procedure is almost the same. At the start point, from the "VeraCrypt Volume Creation Wizard", we have to select the "Create an encrypted file container" option.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/Selection_071.png" alt="veracrypt_2" width="800" height="513" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_071-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_071-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_071-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_071-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_071-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_071-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Then, in the location menu, we have to select where to store the container and choose a name for it.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/Screenshot_20221126_182352.png" alt="volume_name" width="800" height="657" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Screenshot_20221126_182352-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Screenshot_20221126_182352-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Screenshot_20221126_182352-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Screenshot_20221126_182352-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Screenshot_20221126_182352-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Screenshot_20221126_182352-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Now we only have to choose the size of our volume and then we can follow the same steps we have seen above.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/Screenshot_20221126_182544.png" alt="veracrypt_size" width="800" height="513" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Screenshot_20221126_182544-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Screenshot_20221126_182544-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Screenshot_20221126_182544-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Screenshot_20221126_182544-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Screenshot_20221126_182544-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Screenshot_20221126_182544-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<h3>Unlock VeraCrypt volumes</h3>
<p>Access a volume we have encrypted with VeraCrypt is very easy. After starting the tool, we have to choose a location to mount the volume from the list of numbers. Then we have to click on the "Select file..." button if we want to mount a container or on the "Select Device..." button if we want to mount an encrypted storage.</p>
<p>Then we have to click on the Mount button, provide the password and the PIM (if we set it up when creating the volume) and all is done.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/Screenshot_20221126_183645.png" alt="veracrypt_mount" width="600" height="680" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Screenshot_20221126_183645-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Screenshot_20221126_183645-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Screenshot_20221126_183645-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Screenshot_20221126_183645-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Screenshot_20221126_183645-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Screenshot_20221126_183645-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Now can access our volume with our file manager, like a common external device.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/Screenshot_20221126_183812.png" alt="volume" width="1000" height="576" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Screenshot_20221126_183812-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Screenshot_20221126_183812-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Screenshot_20221126_183812-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Screenshot_20221126_183812-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Screenshot_20221126_183812-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Screenshot_20221126_183812-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p class="msg msg--info">When we do not need the volume anymore, we should always dismount it from the VeraCrypt user interface, using the proper button. </p>
<h3>Final thoughts</h3>
<p>Veracrypt gives us a safe way to store information and files and access them from almost any desktop operating system. We have always to consider that adding security to our information requires a bigger caution from our side since if we lose or forget the encryption password or the PIM we have set up, it could be impossible to <a href="https://anubitux.org/try-to-unlock-a-veracrypt-volume-with-anubitux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recover our information</a>. So it is recommended to use passwords we can always remember or we can always access in a safe way.</p>

                <p>Using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, all the transactions we make will stay in the blockchain forever and ever and anyone will be able to check them. Knowing what to look to, it could be possible to perform an investigation of our transactions. Let's see an example of a chain analysis investigation proposed on the <a href="https://osintops.com/blockchain-pat-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">osintops.com</a> blog and performed starting from a <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/3c4c026ce8a285ddc281f78e5f9d00df2c19d627904165696faf8263a6f34761" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">transaction</a> pointed out in <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/how-tos/2019/02/01/tracking-illicit-transactions-with-blockchain-a-guide-featuring-mueller/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this article</a> written by Brenna Smith.</p>
<p>The transaction, according to <a href="https://www.justice.gov/file/1080281/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this document</a>, was carried out by a group of Russian secret agents and was intended to manipulate the work of the US Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign.</p>
<p>Performing such analysis there are two main questions that we need to answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>where are the bitcoins from?</li>
<li>where were they sent?</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach should allow us to identify not so much who managed the bitcoins but rather who could provide us with some information about it, like exchanges and payment processors. Indeed, even if we know that blockchains do not store personal information, nowadays it is almost essential to interact with online services by performing KYC (<em>know your customer</em>) procedures when handling cryptocurrencies.</p>
<h3>Where are the bitcoins from?</h3>
<p>To find an answer to this question we will use one of the many blockchain explorers available: <a href="https://bitcoinwhoswho.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bitcoinwhoswho.com</a>. This service is able to provide additional information about the addresses we are checking (scam reports, links to web pages where they are mentioned, information about the owner, etc.).</p>
<p>In combination we will use <a href="https://www.walletexplorer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">walletexplorer.com</a>: this service uses algorithms that could associate bitcoin addresses with others to reconstruct a wallet and relate it to known entities such as exchanges, darknet markets, gambling sites, etc.</p>
<p>The transaction used to start this analysis was disposed by the address 1LQv8aKtQoiY5M5zkaG8RWL7LMwNzVaVqR. Unfortunately, in this case, the analysis of the address via bitcoinwhoswho.com did not provide any additional information.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image001-800x297.png" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image001-800x297.png 800w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image001-300x111.png 300w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image001-768x285.png 768w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image001.png 1152w" alt="" width="800" height="297" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>We can also observe that the address was involved in only two transactions, one incoming and one outgoing.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image003-800x130.png" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image003-800x130.png 800w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image003-300x49.png 300w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image003-768x124.png 768w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image003.png 1142w" alt="" width="800" height="130" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>Even <a href="https://www.walletexplorer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">walletexplorer.com</a> is not able to provide us any useful information: the wallet consisting of the address being analyzed alone cannot be connected to any known name, nor is any further bitcoin address aggregated that could be associated with the same user.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image005.png" sizes="(max-width: 712px) 100vw, 712px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image005.png 712w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image005-300x67.png 300w" alt="" width="700" height="157" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>To continue finding an answer to our question, let's take another look at the transactions in which the address 1LQv8aKtQoiY5M5zkaG8RWL7LMwNzVaVqR was involved.</p>
<p> The incoming transaction, indicated by the green arrow, comes from the address <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/1HF9VgN3AcA5RJd6ZUPnXdETmFbYmikveN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1HF9VgN3AcA5RJd6ZUPnXdETmFbYmikveN</a>.</p>
<p>This address also made only two transactions of which it is not possible to obtain additional information either via bitcoinwhoswho.com or walletexplorer.com.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image007-800x146.png" sizes="(max-width: 733px) 100vw, 733px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image007-800x146.png 800w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image007-300x55.png 300w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image007.png 1164w" alt="" width="800" height="145" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>So, with the same approach, let's continue to analyze the address that sent bitcoins to the one we are looking to, checking them with bitcoinwhoswho.com and walletexplorer.com.</p>
<p>Doing so, we will encounter this addresses:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>The last address, unlike what happens with the others, receives bitcoins from four different addresses.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image009-1024x205.png" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image009-1024x205.png 1024w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image009-300x60.png 300w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image009-768x154.png 768w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image009.png 1159w" alt="" width="800" height="160" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>These addresses seem to be involved in an intenser activity. Walletexplorer.com clusters all 4 addresses in the wallet with ID <a href="https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/0001d2e72691ea9d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">0001d2e726</a>, whose activities are mostly inbound transactions attributable to the exchange <a href="https://cex.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cex.io</a>.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image011.png" sizes="(max-width: 971px) 100vw, 971px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image011.png 971w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image011-300x296.png 300w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image011-768x757.png 768w" alt="" width="800" height="788" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>So, we are now able to state that the transactions we are looking to involve bitcoins that were purchased through the Cex.io exchange.</p>
<h3>Where were the bitcoins sent?</h3>
<p>Now let's take a look at the transactions disposed by the owners of the bitcoins after they bought them at Cex.io. Looking at the addresses we have encountered by now, we can see that every time there is an outgoing transaction sending coins to two addresses:</p>
<ul>
<li>one receiving a larger amount which is gradually carried forward from transaction to transaction;</li>
<li>one receiving a smaller amount, which often consists of more decimal digits. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Peel chains</h4>
<p>This transactions schema is usually called peel chain. In peel chains, users send bitcoin to an intended destination address, maybe because they are paying something, and receive the remaining part, named change, on a new address that is in their control. This happens because the Bitcoin protocol does not allow to spend any desired amount but only allows to forward amounts that were previously received and have not yet been involved in transactions. These amounts are called UTxOs (unspent transaction outputs).</p>
<p>Analyzing peel chains can give us two kinds of information:</p>
<ul>
<li>we can collect a lot of addresses belonging to the target of our identification;</li>
<li>we will encounter a lot of payments made by the target of our investigations and, some of them could lead us to new evidence regarding our target.</li>
</ul>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Concept-Diagram_EN-1.png" sizes="(max-width: 481px) 100vw, 481px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Concept-Diagram_EN-1.png 481w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Concept-Diagram_EN-1-300x115.png 300w" alt="" width="481" height="184" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>The main challenge in this kind of analysis is to determine which address is receiving the change and which one is the recipient of the payment. This can be done by making <a href="https://anubitux.org/clustering-bitcoin-addresses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">considerations</a> on the amounts and the addresses involved. So, we should be able to determine, for any transaction, which address will receive the funds of the target of our investigation and which one is receiving their payment.</p>
<h4>How to go up the chain of transactions</h4>
<p>Let's start following the chain from the first address that received the bitcoins purchased from Cex.io. This is the starting point of the peel chain.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image014.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 643px) 100vw, 643px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image014.jpg 643w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image014-300x36.jpg 300w" alt="" width="640" height="77" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>In this case, the address that receives 0.8 bitcoin, 1N5hfyuGVZbTR78zXQ22kjUyCwZbgB8yhw, is most likely the actual destination address, while the address that receives 11.04445 bitcoin, 1GN5ZGGQsgQGQdP5Yc2LAWUKssrLk5YR, is the change address. It is very unlikely that a user could make a transaction of 11.04445 bitcoins (even by specifying the sending amount in FIAT currency on their client) and get a change of exactly 0.8 bitcoins.</p>
<p>Analyzing the address 1N5hfyuGVZbTR78zXQ22kjUyCwZbgB8yhw with walletexplorer.com, it is not traced back to any known person or entity.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image016.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 531px) 100vw, 531px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image016.jpg 531w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image016-300x44.jpg 300w" alt="" width="500" height="73" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>This does not mean that it is not possible to trace the address to an exchanger or a payment intermediary but rather that walletexplorer.com was unable to identify who presumably controls the address.</p>
<p>Continuing to follow the sequence of payments, observing the transaction made from the change address 1GN5ZGGQsgQGQdP5Yc2LAWUKssrLk5YRbc and considering the behavior assumed in the other transactions examined, we can assume that the actual recipient is the address 1Mut7bPWhQS2NkTQ6wUpRtbV65vyELBqcs and the change address is 1ECFBdcnfhVWcGG6k4p4Pt4J9ciQsK8wEn.</p>
<p> </p>
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image018.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 643px) 100vw, 643px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image018.jpg 643w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image018-300x25.jpg 300w" alt="" width="640" height="54" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></div>
<p>Analyzing the information provided by walletexplorer.com, confirming what we hypothesized a little while ago, 1Mut7bPWhQS2NkTQ6wUpRtbV65vyELBqcs is traced back to the payment intermediary BitPay.com.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image020.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 530px) 100vw, 530px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image020.jpg 530w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image020-300x42.jpg 300w" alt="" width="530" height="74" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></div>
<p>Now, look at the outgoing transaction made from the address 1ECFBdcnfhVWcGG6k4p4Pt4J9ciQsK8wEn.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image022.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image022.jpg 642w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image022-300x24.jpg 300w" alt="Transazione 3" width="640" height="52" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></div>
<p>We assume, with the same criteria adopted for the previous transactions, that the destination address is 1ChwFk9Wtq7zav6TRnxE8e8xgf5daFXV5D, while the change address is 1MYQzejdwhiU83qy4SsLKcm7CwV5XxVFRn. Also, in this case, walletexplorer.com was unable to link it to any known service.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image024.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 527px) 100vw, 527px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image024.jpg 527w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image024-300x35.jpg 300w" alt="Wallet Explorer 3" width="520" height="60" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></div>
<p>Continuing along the flow of transactions, analyzing the transactions disposed by every encountered change address, we can find the following destination addresses:</p>
<ul>
<li>13ov4UBJYJQBC1Tv5vEvijShn2vWS3vPrJ, not attributable to any entity;</li>
<li>1Atc1n6rCm7GMpW1JsRuwF8b2hWQJjxi6i, not attributable to any entity, but recipient of an unusually high amount equal to 5 bitcoins;</li>
<li>13DD8uH3FMZbJjXnSgZfL2MMTxesT9qUgJ, not attributable to any entity but grouped with other 6 addresses that could be further examined;</li>
<li>1Hy8Comf7wyBtqgGzph3fX8Ky6S5t8eXeh, attributable to the same wallet as the address in the previous point;</li>
<li>1DLTLvpev16LemyDtuyEL2WnyLskcPSvKM, attributable to CoinPayments.net;</li>
</ul>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image026.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image026.jpg 533w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image026-300x37.jpg 300w" alt="" width="530" height="65" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<ul>
<li>1J8LeRgSwuHqfJuFX3Uo62WnDNFsNuAygR, attributable to BitPay.com;</li>
</ul>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image028.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 535px) 100vw, 535px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image028.jpg 535w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image028-300x41.jpg 300w" alt="" width="530" height="72" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<ul>

<li>14mUSXvddwR9qgBr93BGXEAcgRw84jEtaG, not attributable to any entity;</li>
<li>1NZ4MSeYcDKFiPRt8h7VK6XMhShwzhCzCp, not attributable to any entity.</li>
</ul>
<p>This last address is the one that received the transaction from the address 1LQv8aKtQoiY5M5zkaG8RWL7LMwNzVaVqR, cited in the article from which we began our analysis.</p>
<h4>Let's recap</h4>
<p>Returning to the main discourse, in the following image, we can graphically observe what we have reconstructed so far with our analysis. The change addresses are represented by circles that get smaller and smaller, to represent the part of bitcoin that is used to make payments.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Grafo-Parte2.png" sizes="(max-width: 974px) 100vw, 974px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Grafo-Parte2.png 974w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Grafo-Parte2-300x77.png 300w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Grafo-Parte2-768x197.png 768w" alt="" width="970" height="249" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<h4>What else should we look at?</h4>
<p>To obtain more information, the aforementioned wallet of seven addresses, including 13DD8uH3FMZbJjXnSgZfL2MMTxesT9qUgJ and 1Hy8Comf7wyBtqgGzph3fX8Ky6S5t8eXeh, could be examined.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we can observe that the aforementioned address 1Atc1n6rCm7GMpW1JsRuwF8b2hWQJjxi6i, with the transaction made on 23 December 2015, receives 5.0 bitcoins, unlike other transactions where the amounts are much smaller. This could be a more substantial payment but, considering that less than 12 bitcoins were handled at the beginning of the transaction sequence, it could also be that the user of these addresses wanted to split the managed bitcoins and start another sequence of transactions. In fact, the following transaction is destined in favor of the addresses 1HbKVbT2k82JcMrvErwWMhJPGHjSo8iLBK and 1JX9Q7fqn9TajUe4F6vjWGtGnD2wqnXTii. Of these, the address 1HbKVbT2k82JcMrvErwWMhJPGHjSo8iLBK is associated, by walletexplorer.com, to the payment intermediary BitPay.com.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image030.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 528px) 100vw, 528px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image030.jpg 528w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image030-300x37.jpg 300w" alt="" width="500" height="62" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<h3>And now?</h3>
<p>Now we arrived at the starting point of our analysis and we were able to determine that the target of our investigation bought bitcoins from Cex.io and made many payments, also using payment processors like BitPay.com and CoinPayments.com. So, let's take a look at what our targets made with their bitcoins after the aforementioned transaction.</p>
<p>We can see that the transactions continue with the same pattern: one address receives a lower bitcoin amount and with fewer decimal digits and another receives the so-called change of the transaction, a higher amount and with more decimal places.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image001-1-1024x93.png" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image001-1-1024x93.png 1024w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image001-1-300x27.png 300w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image001-1-768x70.png 768w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image001-1.png 1134w" alt="" width="800" height="73" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>With the same rules used up to now, we can state that the address 1NZ4MSeYcDKFiPRt8h7VK6XMhShwzhCzCp is the one that receives the bitcoins, while the address 1AK79g9gpvZ8jn2C9MsWQpijMFA5JaTdqP is the one that receives the remainder of the transaction.</p>
<p>In this case, <a href="https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/2cba7ba8b8d067d6?from_address=1NZ4MSeYcDKFiPRt8h7VK6XMhShwzhCzCp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">walletexplorer.com</a> does not give us any information on the destination address.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image003-1.png" sizes="(max-width: 803px) 100vw, 803px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image003-1.png 803w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image003-1-300x103.png 300w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image003-1-768x265.png 768w" alt="" width="800" height="276" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>Now let's look to the change address 1AK79g9gpvZ8jn2C9MsWQpijMFA5JaTdqP with bitcoinwhoswho.com.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image005-1-1024x164.png" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image005-1-1024x164.png 1024w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image005-1-300x48.png 300w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image005-1-768x123.png 768w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image005-1.png 1144w" alt="" width="800" height="128" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>Also in this case the situation is the same seen in most of the cases of our analysis. By now we shouldn’t have difficulty recognizing that the address 153LqeB1mQa8xDaQDyvhWTCNweVTDeH9BE is the actual destination of the payment while the address 1RBiVomgGeqqRm4NQkJhmffWtAfJDdjFr receives the change. So let’s see what <a href="https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/CoinPayments.net?from_address=153LqeB1mQa8xDaQDyvhWTCNweVTDeH9BE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">walletexplorer.com</a> can tell us about the payment destination address.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image007-1.png" sizes="(max-width: 722px) 100vw, 722px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image007-1.png 722w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image007-1-300x42.png 300w" alt="" width="700" height="97" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>In this case, the address was traced to CoinPayments.net. Let’s continue with our analysis and see what happens in the subsequent transactions. To do this we need to analyze the transactions made by the address 1RBiVomgGeqqRm4NQkJhmffWtAfJDdjFr.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image009-1-1024x180.png" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image009-1-1024x180.png 1024w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image009-1-300x53.png 300w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image009-1-768x135.png 768w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image009-1.png 1151w" alt="" width="800" height="141" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>If we search for the destination address with <a href="https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/00009799370b78be?from_address=1MM3YT9khXudNqgUxUXSPHhA2RHKoS37iv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">walletexplorer.com</a>, we notice that it is not traced back to any known entity, but is still associated with a wallet with great activity, 211.023 transactions! Similar behavior is typical of an exchange or payment intermediary. It is difficult to imagine a person carrying out such several transactions.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image011-1.png" sizes="(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image011-1.png 975w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image011-1-300x114.png 300w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image011-1-768x292.png 768w" alt="" width="800" height="304" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>Going forward, observing the transactions carried out from the change address identified from time to time, we will notice the following payment destination addresses:</p>
<ul>
<li>1AV6NxfKYTwDSqbcGFn76KtAFHwCDYScHi, not related to any entity, but associated with the same wallet with ID 0000979937 of the previous case;</li>
<li>1G85zgoQu1VeEaH4gQwyfS9VQqUxBJD6bb, not linked to any entity, but associated with the same wallet with ID 0000979937 of the previous cases;</li>
<li>1MYQwTsamJ18WnaeggkF4Tboms5ySHp2VA, not linked to any entity, but associated with the same wallet with ID 0000979937 of the previous cases;</li>
<li>1PQAL7HxjzuoKVAbbTijkZ3mPZWhtgEjYM, not related to any entity, but associated with the same wallet with ID 0000979937 of the previous cases;</li>
<li>1MRFjrnChHPMP9WH797Tg27eZNzQexQW6S, not attributed to any entity;</li>
<li>1EMVNB1aGTdL48oi2T6t4wZLUDQ9Kc5ddv, not linked to any entity, but associated with the same wallet with ID 0000979937 of the previous cases.</li>
</ul>
<p>Continuing, we arrive at the address 1HvWTwViSsy8j5Z9QWCGKKFiSCgDe1uLAM, which receives the change of the previous transactions. Looking closely at the transaction amounts, it could seem a bit strange.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image013-1024x179.png" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image013-1024x179.png 1024w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image013-300x52.png 300w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image013-768x134.png 768w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image013.png 1150w" alt="" width="800" height="140" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>Indeed, the address seems to receive 1.37587747 bitcoins, but it spends 2.70223736! It seems absurd. Instead, it is a deceptive display of information provided by bitcoinwhoswho.com. The service only displays information strictly related to the address you searched for. To understand what happened, we must first note the string 23e7879eaa2c2757d049f1a22a176dda4907be407aa70fdcc3ea4a5b57754f52 written above the “anomalous” transaction. This is the transaction identifier, called hash. To be able to understand it we need to query another blockchain explorer, for example, <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blockchain.com</a>.<br><br>By doing so, we can see that the address 1HvWTwViSsy8j5Z9QWCGKKFiSCgDe1uLAM is not the only sender of the transaction.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/25/Selection_011-2.png" alt="" width="800" height="120" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/25/responsive/Selection_011-2-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/25/responsive/Selection_011-2-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/25/responsive/Selection_011-2-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/25/responsive/Selection_011-2-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/25/responsive/Selection_011-2-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/25/responsive/Selection_011-2-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>The bitcoins also come from the address 16xyGaTT2dQipfhUz8rNPR4L98xx7zQ9Et. If a transaction comes from two addresses or more addresses, the person who made it must have the private keys of all of them to sign it. In this case, we can therefore say that the user has both addresses, or that both addresses are part of the same wallet.</p>
<p>Note that the address 16xyGaTT2dQipfhUz8rNPR4L98xx7zQ9Et already had some bitcoins available when we encountered it. So this address will also have its own history and flow of transactions. If we begin to observe the transactions linked to this flow, we notice that the behavior is almost identical to that seen so far.</p>
<p>Our address receives its bitcoins from the address 17SLcA24f4s3RXupPWWAdJsfJcdhyRivfF.</p>

<p>This address, continuing backward, receives the bitcoins from the address 17GKzWc4m7kEPxvoHAtPisvtZ7Qnk2sMd and carries out a single outbound transaction, of which the address 1ZeSmMCHFqd6Gg8y3NhrChVTyTPbUkneJ that receives 0.144816 bitcoin is that of the actual destination and the address 16xyGaTT2dQipfhUz8rNPR4L98xx7zQ9Et that receives 1.32640989 bitcoin is the change one.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image019-1024x158.png" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image019-1024x158.png 1024w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image019-300x46.png 300w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image019-768x118.png 768w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image019.png 1144w" alt="" width="800" height="123" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>By going backward, we can try to get to the point where these bitcoins may have been bought. Using the same techniques we have seen so far we can see that the bitcoins come from the same wallet linked to Cex.io, which we met in the first part, with ID 0001d2e726 on walletexplorer.com.</p>
<p>Here is an image that can help to understand what is happening. There are two flows of transactions that start from the Cex.io exchange (this suggests us there were two purchases made by our targets from that exchange): one is the one we followed in the first two parts of our analysis and one is the one we have just encountered. The two flows merge when the bitcoins in the availability of the addresses 1ZeSmMCHFqd6Gg8y3NhrChVTyTPbUkneJ and 16xyGaTT2dQipfhUz8rNPR4L98xx7zQ9Et are used to carry out the same transaction.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Concept-Diagram_EN_P3-800x336.png" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Concept-Diagram_EN_P3-800x336.png 800w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Concept-Diagram_EN_P3-300x126.png 300w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Concept-Diagram_EN_P3-768x323.png 768w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Concept-Diagram_EN_P3.png 862w" alt="" width="800" height="336" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>So far we have only taken care of the senders of the transaction where we noticed the cospending by two addresses. But let's also take a look at the recipients of the transaction.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image023.png" sizes="(max-width: 691px) 100vw, 691px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image023.png 691w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image023-300x41.png 300w" alt="" width="650" height="88" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>We find the address 1DqYiuVPjxrS3tkE8VeSorvx4ZEeR3oGkZ, which receives 0.20223736 bitcoins, and the address 1AgEeJ1cNWpXxABaTysv4CM6MqARSnXFce, which receives exactly 2.5.</p>
<p>With the criteria adopted so far, we will certainly agree that the address that receives 2.5 bitcoins is the actual destination. We said that a user is unlikely to want to make a transaction by specifying an amount of 8 decimal places, resulting in a change of exactly 2.5 bitcoins.</p>
<p>In this case, we can strengthen our claim considering that we have seen two sender addresses. If a user wanted to transfer 0.20223736 bitcoins it would not make sense to use both the sender. In fact, at the time of the transaction, observing the history of transactions received by each of the senders, the address 16xyGaTT2dQipfhUz8rNPR4L98xx7zQ9Et had 1,32640989 bitcoins available.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image025-1024x72.png" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image025-1024x72.png 1024w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image025-300x21.png 300w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image025-768x54.png 768w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image025.png 1142w" alt="" width="800" height="56" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>and the address 1HvWTwViSsy8j5Z9QWCGKKFiSCgDe1uLAM had 1.3758774 bitcoins available.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image027-1024x66.png" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image027-1024x66.png 1024w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image027-300x19.png 300w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image027-768x50.png 768w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image027.png 1141w" alt="" width="800" height="52" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>So we can assume that our target had the intention to transfer 2.5 bitcoins. If the user of the addresses had wanted to transfer only 0.20223736 bitcoins, it would have been enough for him to use only one of the two addresses.</p>
<p>Since we have found abnormal behavior compared to what we have seen so far, we need to carefully analyze what both destination addresses do: we could find ourselves in front of either a more substantial payment, or a consolidation transaction, that is, a transaction carried out to collect the balances available on multiple addresses in one.</p>
<p>Continuing to analyze our flow of transactions, from the address 1DqYiuVPjxrS3tkE8VeSorvx4ZEeR3oGkZ we will find a situation similar to what we have seen by now, with transactions that have two destinations addresses, a recipient and a change.</p>
<p>In the picture, we can see a reconstruction of what's happening.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Concept-Diagram_EN_P4-800x455.png" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Concept-Diagram_EN_P4-800x455.png 800w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Concept-Diagram_EN_P4-300x171.png 300w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Concept-Diagram_EN_P4-768x437.png 768w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Concept-Diagram_EN_P4.png 972w" alt="" width="800" height="455" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>Continuing to follow the peel chain as we did so far, we will find the address 155HWPsNcBGxMuMgiQjhAUD2ggCMGLVm9X.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/immagine-1.png" sizes="(max-width: 721px) 100vw, 721px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/immagine-1.png 721w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/immagine-1-300x213.png 300w" alt="" width="700" height="497" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>The address was only involved in an incoming transaction. The actual amount, 0.00003139 is so small that the user has probably decided to don’t use it anymore.</p>
<p>At this point, we can say that we have followed a flow of bitcoins in which multiple transactions were made to different payment processors, gradually reducing the amount that was carried forward as change, up to an amount of practically zero and above all point where the flow of transactions stops.</p>
<h4>The 2.5 bitcoins transactions</h4>
<p>We do not have to forget that we have yet to observe where the 2.5 bitcoin transaction mentioned above went.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/25/Selection_012.png" alt="" width="800" height="118" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/25/responsive/Selection_012-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/25/responsive/Selection_012-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/25/responsive/Selection_012-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/25/responsive/Selection_012-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/25/responsive/Selection_012-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/25/responsive/Selection_012-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>In this part of our analysis, let’s see what happens to the 2.5 bitcoins transferred. Such a precise amount was certainly intentionally transferred, it is not a random change. However, in most of the transactions examined so far, we have seen much smaller amounts sent to the actual recipients. Therefore, it is good practice in an analysis of any kind, to pay more attention to all those behaviors that “break” the regularity, trying to identify the reasons that could have given rise to the anomaly.</p>
<p>Let’s immediately start looking at what has been done with the address we are examining.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image003-800x97.png" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image003-800x97.png 800w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image003-300x36.png 300w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image003-768x93.png 768w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image003.png 1159w" alt="" width="800" height="97" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>The address was involved in a single outgoing transaction, in favor of two addresses: 1J8kvixEnAnGDEDwkfqJS246sXdW1mhkvB, which receives 0.99805659 bitcoins, and 1NPgLU4sVj5ww2UZ8DktDSYm7kLJN6sYq1, which receives 1.501685 bitcoins. In this case, it is not at all easy to understand which of the two is the actual destination address and which is the change address. A single sender address is involved, which spends all the available balance, and both destination addresses receive an amount with 8 decimal digits.</p>
<p>So, to avoid that we can miss something, we must carefully examine both addresses, looking for behaviors similar to those already seen so far or for interactions with known entities.</p>
<h5>First recipient address</h5>
<p>Let’s start by observing the behavior of the address 1J8kvixEnAnGDEDwkfqJS246sXdW1mhkvB, which received 0.99805659 bitcoins.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/immagine-10-800x352.png" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/immagine-10-800x352.png 800w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/immagine-10-300x132.png 300w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/immagine-10-768x338.png 768w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/immagine-10.png 843w" alt="" width="800" height="352" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>Unlike what we have seen so far, this address received an amount of almost one bitcoin but did not spend it. In these cases, checking the address with <a href="https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/89f0e040d9c409ad?from_address=1J8kvixEnAnGDEDwkfqJS246sXdW1mhkvB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">walletexplorer.com</a> will not give great results. The data shown by this service are based on the activity that was done with the addresses. In this case, since there has been practically no activity, it will not be possible to group this address with others or to trace it back to known entities.</p>
<p>This is a new situation, we have an address that has a substantial amount of bitcoins and has not yet spent them. This does not mean that the user, from one day to the next, cannot decide to use this address to carry out a new transaction and provide us with new information.</p>
<p>However, even if in this case we have only one address to observe, as it could carry out transactions, it is not at all practical to think of checking every day if the balance has changed.</p>
<p>In such cases, we can take advantage of a service that is right for us, offered by the <a href="https://www.blockonomics.co/blockonomics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blockonomics</a> site. Once we have created a free account, we have a service called “Wallet Watcher”, which allows us to keep an eye on multiple addresses simultaneously.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image009-800x158.png" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image009.png 800w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image009-300x59.png 300w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image009-768x152.png 768w" alt="" width="800" height="158" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>We can add multiple addresses and label them for easy recognition. From the settings tab, ticking the appropriate box we will receive an e-mail alert whenever one of the observed addresses is involved in any activity.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image011.png" sizes="(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image011.png 632w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image011-300x168.png 300w" alt="" width="600" height="336" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<h5>Second recipient address</h5>
<p>Continuing our analysis, let’s now look at the address 1NPgLU4sVj5ww2UZ8DktDSYm7kLJN6sYq1 which received 1.50168541 bitcoin, in the transaction reported at the beginning of this part of our analysis.</p>
<p>In this case, the bitcoins were all spent, in a single transaction.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/25/Selection_013.png" alt="" width="800" height="406" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/25/responsive/Selection_013-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/25/responsive/Selection_013-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/25/responsive/Selection_013-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/25/responsive/Selection_013-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/25/responsive/Selection_013-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/25/responsive/Selection_013-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>This is a single transaction that sees 11 other addresses among the senders and was carried out in favor of 6 other addresses. In our analysis, we have never encountered a transaction involving so many addresses. Instead of starting immediately to examine all the addresses, grouping them in a single wallet and observing each of them where it got its bitcoins, let’s try to understand who we are in front of. Let’s search our address with <a href="https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/0001c7f9dcc8ba8f?from_address=1NPgLU4sVj5ww2UZ8DktDSYm7kLJN6sYq1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">walletexplorer.com</a>.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image014-800x521.png" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image014-800x521.png 800w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image014-300x196.png 300w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image014-768x501.png 768w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image014.png 827w" alt="" width="800" height="521" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>As we can see, walletexplorer.com has grouped the address in a wallet that has carried out 232.621 transactions! It is a wallet that, based on the reconstructions carried out by the algorithms of walletexplorer.com, contains 37.632 addresses, too many for a single person.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image016.png" sizes="(max-width: 766px) 100vw, 766px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image016.png 766w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image016-300x163.png 300w" alt="" width="750" height="408" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>Let’s go back for a moment to the previous image, which shows the activity carried out with the wallet which includes the address we are examining. As we can see, outgoing transactions are directed to <a href="https://spectrocoin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spectrocoin.com</a>.</p>
<p>What could have happened?</p>
<p>Let’s start by understanding what spectrocoin.com is. It is an online service that allows you to exchange different types of virtual currencies with each other or to buy and sell them using FIAT currencies.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/25/Selection_014.png" alt="" width="700" height="872" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/25/responsive/Selection_014-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/25/responsive/Selection_014-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/25/responsive/Selection_014-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/25/responsive/Selection_014-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/25/responsive/Selection_014-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/25/responsive/Selection_014-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>However, the currencies displayed at the time of the analysis may be different from those accepted at the time of the transaction. Let’s try to understand what the situation was at the time of the transaction, therefore, approximately, in  April 2016. To do this we can use a service called <a href="https://web.archive.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WayBack Machine</a>. Let’s search the spectrocoin.com page and view the available data.</p>

<p>There are various data relating to 2016. In particular, there is a capture of the site that dates back to April 8, coincidentally the day on which the transaction we are studying was carried out.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image022-800x264.png" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image022.png 800w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image022-300x99.png 300w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image022-768x253.png 768w" alt="" width="800" height="264" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>As we can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325153601/https:/spectrocoin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">see</a>, at the time of the transaction, the site only supported Bitcoin and no other virtual currency. In particular, the site could be only used to buy and sell bitcoins.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image024-800x356.png" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image024-800x356.png 800w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image024-300x133.png 300w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image024-768x342.png 768w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image024.png 881w" alt="" width="800" height="356" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>At this point, we can assume that the 1.50168541 bitcoins transaction, carried out to the address 1NPgLU4sVj5ww2UZ8DktDSYm7kLJN6sYq1, was aimed at exchanging bitcoins into FIAT currency or making a payment through the SpectroCoin virtual card. Unfortunately, at this point, the information is no longer present in the blockchain but is in the exclusive availability of those who manage spectrocoin.com.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Starting with a single bitcoin transaction, we were able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>identify other related transaction flows;</li>
<li>understand that the bitcoins were probably purchased from the Cex.io exchange;</li>
<li>reconstruct the scheme by which bitcoins were regularly used to send payments through BitPay.com and CoinPayments.com, following the rest of the transactions;</li>
<li>follow a flow of transactions until its exhaustion;</li>
<li>identify when bitcoins have likely been converted back into FIAT currency via SpectroCoin.com.</li>
</ul>
<p>The analysis we conducted started with a casual transaction. The scenario in front of us is always unpredictable. The more tools we master, the greater chances we will have of being able to productively analyze any scenario we will encounter.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, once we arrive at an exchange, it would unlikely share information about its customers with us, unless we can use the powers of the law Enforcement Agencies or of the Judiciary.</p>

            <![CDATA[
                    <p><img src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/python-gbd1e5efef_1920.jpg" class="type:primaryImage" alt="" /></p>
                <p>When coding with Python, one of the bigger matters we have to deal with its dependencies. With a community as big as Python's one, this problem couldn't remain unsolved! In fact, we can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">virtual environments</a>, a solution that allows us to execute every Python script with its own version of the libraries it uses. This helps us to avoid conflicts between scripts needing different versions of the same library or between incompatible libraries.</p>
<h3>How virtual environments work </h3>
<p>First of all, we need to install Python virtual environments to be able to use them. To do that we can simply run:</p>
<p><code>pip3 install venv</code></p>
<p>Now, when we write a Python script or download some from <a href="https://github.com/search?l=Python&amp;q=python&amp;type=Repositories" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>, like one of <a href="https://github.com/ASeriousMister" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ours</a>, we can open our Terminal and change the working directory with the path of the tool:</p>
<p><code>cd /home/anubitux/Tools/python_tool</code></p>
<p>Now, let's create our virtual environment:</p>
<p><code>virtualenv demo</code></p>
<p>This is going to create a python virtual environment named "demo", that will be placed in a newly created folder in the tool's directory.</p>
<p>At this point, we need to activate it, and all the libraries we are going to install will only be used within our virtual environment:</p>
<p><code>source demo/bin/activate</code></p>
<p>Now, to be sure our virtual environment is active, we can see its name in brackets on the left of our username in our terminal.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/Selection_055.png" alt="venv1" width="900" height="143" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/responsive/Selection_055-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/responsive/Selection_055-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/responsive/Selection_055-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/responsive/Selection_055-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/responsive/Selection_055-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/responsive/Selection_055-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Now we can install our libraries, running</p>
<p><code>pip3 -r install requirements.txt</code></p>
<p>if the tool we are going to use has a list of dependencies placed in the conventional <em>requirements.txt</em> file, or simply running</p>
<p><code>pip3 install python_library_name</code></p>
<p>When our environment is ready, we can run our tool:</p>
<p><code>python3 demo_tool.py</code></p>
<p>If we are done, we can stop our virtual environment running:</p>
<p><code>deactivate</code></p>
<p>So the virtual environment's name in brackets will disappear.</p>
<h3>How Anu₿itux uses virtual environments</h3>
<p>Anu₿itux uses many different <a href="https://anubitux.org/what-is-anubitux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Python tools</a>, some of them developed by our <a href="https://anubitux.org/meet-the-anubitux-project/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">team</a>, some of them developed by other trusted developers. Of course, our users wouldn't feel comfortable activating a different virtual environment every time they need to run a Python tool. So we adopted a solution suggested by our friends from the <a href="https://tsurugi-linux.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tsurugi Linux</a> team.</p>
<p>First of all, we created an environment for every single tool, with the procedure shown above. Then, to make sure that our tool is going to use it without the need to activate it, we placed its directory in the first commented line of every tool. This is the way to specify for every tool where it has to take the libraries it is going to use.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/Selection_056.png" alt="comment" width="500" height="109" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/responsive/Selection_056-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/responsive/Selection_056-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/responsive/Selection_056-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/responsive/Selection_056-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/responsive/Selection_056-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/responsive/Selection_056-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>in the example, <em>ssve</em> is the name we gave to the virtual environment.</p>
<p>It is important to indicate <em>python3</em> at the end of the line. This way we will be able to launch the tool without the need to specify it in the Terminal.</p>
<p class="msg msg--info">Doing that, it could happen that a python3 file is not available in the virtual environment folder. If so, we can place a <a href="https://linuxhint.com/create_symbolic_link_ubuntu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">symbolic link</a> into it pointing to <em>/usr/bin/python3</em>.</p>
<p>Now, to be able to run the tool without the need to go to its directory, using root privileges we'll add a symbolic link to it in a directory that is included in the $PATH system variable, like <em>/usr/bin</em>. The $PATH system variable controls where our system is going to look for the commands we enter in our Terminal.</p>
<p><code>sudo ln -s demo_tool.py /usr/bin/</code></p>
<p>Finally we need to add the execution rights to the symbolic link:</p>
<p><code>sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/demo_tool.py</code></p>
<p>Now, after restarting our Terminal, we will be able to run our tools as all the other commands we are used to!</p>
<h3>Something to pay attention to</h3>
<p>A lot of python tools do not use only libraries, but also some files placed in their folder. When launching them from our Terminal in any working directory, they won't be able to find those files. To solve this, we need to add a line to our python tool that makes its process run in the correct directory:</p>
<p><code>os.chdir('/path/of/the/tool')</code></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/Selection_057.png" alt="oschdir" width="450" height="61" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/responsive/Selection_057-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/responsive/Selection_057-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/responsive/Selection_057-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/responsive/Selection_057-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/responsive/Selection_057-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/responsive/Selection_057-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>

                    <p><img src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/dice-g609db9c73_1920.jpg" class="type:primaryImage" alt="" /></p>
                <p>In a <a href="https://anubitux.org/how-to-generate-random-paper-wallets-with-anubitux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">previous post</a>, we have seen how to obtain a paper wallet by rolling a dice 256 times and tracking results with <a href="https://github.com/ASeriousMister/DiceTracker.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dicetracker.py</a>, a tool developed by the Anu₿itux team. This tool supports the creation of paper wallets for many different currencies but not for all. Let's now see how to obtain a <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BIP39</a> valid mnemonic seed starting from the entropy obtained by rolling a dice many times. This way, we can use this mnemonic seed to <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">derive</a> private keys and addresses for many different kinds of coins. This is how this tool works!</p>
<h3>OpSec first!</h3>
<p>When generating a new mnemonic seed, it is very important to pay a lot of attention to the procedure we are using. If something goes wrong or if we leak some information, we could lose our coins. For this purpose, if we use it properly, Anu₿itux could give us great help.</p>
<p>Let's begin starting <a href="https://anubitux.org/how-to-use-anubitux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anu₿itux live</a> from our USB stick! Working in a live environment will leave no traces of what we are doing on the internal drives of our devices. Then, to be sure no information is leaving our devices, let's use the 'Offline' script placed on the upper left corner of our home screen.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/Selection_045.png" alt="offline" width="350" height="355" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_045-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_045-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_045-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_045-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_045-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_045-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Now, if we are in a safe place, without any recording device or indiscreet eyes around us, we can start generating our new mnemonic seed.</p>
<h3>Generating entropy</h3>
<p>First of all, let's start the tool <a href="https://github.com/ASeriousMister/Dice2Seed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dice2Seed.py</a>, by simply typing its name in our terminal window.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/Selection_047.png" alt="dice2seed1" width="900" height="179" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_047-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_047-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_047-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_047-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_047-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_047-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>The tool first of all asks us how many bits of entropy we want to obtain to generate our seed. This will affect the length of our <a href="https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/mnemonic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mnemonic seed</a>, according to the following scheme.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/Selection_048.png" alt="scheme" width="250" height="209" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_048-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_048-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_048-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_048-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_048-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_048-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>In the first column, we have the bits of entropy, in the second the bits of the checksum (obtained from <em>bits of entropy / 32</em>), in the third the length in bits of our seed and in the fourth the number of words of our mnemonic seed. This depends on how seeds are generated from entropy:</p>
<ul>
<li>sha256 hash is calculated on our entropy;</li>
<li>a checksum is obtained with a bit of the sha256 result for every 32 bits of entropy;</li>
<li>checksum is appended to entropy, giving us the seed;</li>
<li>seed is divided into groups of 11 bits (adding a bit every 32 bits of entropy, our seed's length will always a multiple of 33, that is itself a multiple of 11);</li>
<li>every 11 bits group is converted to decimals and gives us the index of the word in the <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/tree/master/bip-0039" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bip39 wordlists</a>, since a number of 11 can give a decimal between 0 and 2047. For this reason, we have 2048 words in the bip39 wordlists.</li>
</ul>
<p>In our case, let's hypothesize we want to obtain a mnemonic seed starting from 128 bits of entropy.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/Selection_049.png" alt="dice2seed2" width="900" height="227" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_049-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_049-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_049-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_049-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_049-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_049-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Now we will be prompted to paste the result of 128 previously made dice rolls or we can use the tool to track the rolls we are making while running it.</p>
<p>In this case, we will paste a 128 digits string, but we could also paste an entropy string made by 0s and 1s or use the tool to help us to track dice rolls.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/Selection_050.png" alt="dice2seed3" width="900" height="287" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_050-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_050-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_050-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_050-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_050-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_050-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<h3>Obtaining the mnemonic seed</h3>
<p>Now we only have to choose the language we prefer for our mnemonic seed, indicating the corresponding number, and mission complete! We obtained our mnemonic seed!</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/Selection_051.png" alt="dice2seed4" width="900" height="486" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_051-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_051-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_051-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_051-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_051-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_051-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<h3>How to use our seed</h3>
<p>Now we can use our seed accordingly to our needs:</p>
<ul>
<li>we could paste it in our BIP39 compatible wallet and start receiving and disposing transactions;</li>
<li>we can use it with our hardware wallet;</li>
<li>we can derive private keys and addresses with the <a href="https://github.com/iancoleman/bip39" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ian Coleman's BIP39 tool</a>, that is already available in Anu₿itux without the need to connect to the Internet.</li>
</ul>
<p>The last solution could be a good one if we are using this procedure to arrange a safe cold storage for our coins. To do it, we can start the Ian Coleman's tool from the WalletTools menu in Anu₿itux, and paste our mnemonic seed in the corresponding box.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/Selection_052.png" alt="iancoleman1" width="1000" height="369" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_052-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_052-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_052-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_052-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_052-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_052-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Then we only have to choose the coin of which we want to have private keys and addresses and, scrolling down the page, we will find all that we need to prepare our cold storage.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/Selection_053.png" alt="iancoleman2" width="1000" height="288" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_053-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_053-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_053-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_053-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_053-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_053-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Now we can choose one or more addresses, with the related private key, and prepare a paper wallet to store in a safe place. If we also want to generate QR codes for our paper wallet, we can use the <a href="https://github.com/fukuchi/libqrencode/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">qrencode</a> tool:</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/Selection_054.png" alt="qrencode" width="800" height="302" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_054-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_054-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_054-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_054-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_054-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_054-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Of course, if we are intended to use the generated addresses only to receive coins and store them in a safe place, it might be enough to take note only of the public addresses. If in the future we will need to spend our coins, we could do that in a BIP39 compatible wallet.</p>
<p>We could also use the Ian Coleman's tool to obtain addresses of many different coins from the same mnemonic seed.</p>
<p>We should also be able to print our paper wallets without the need to connect to the Internet, exposing our working environment, since Anu₿itux has a lot of printer drivers already installed.</p>
<h3>Final thoughts</h3>
<p>When generating a mnemonic seed or a paper wallet, no care is enough! These are very sensible operations and doing some mistakes or operating with carelessness could compromise our funds. Cryptocurrencies are great because they let us be our bank, but this also implies that we are responsible for our funds.</p>
<p>We should also pay attention to the tools we use during our process. We should prefer simple and open-source tools, that we could easily inspect to be sure about how they handle our precious information. </p>

                    <p><img src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/game-g07f257a77_1920.jpg" class="type:primaryImage" alt="" /></p>
                <p>For many reasons, it could happen that we do not have access to our complete mnemonic seed. For instance, we could have written it by hand too quickly and now we are not able to read it anymore, or we could have hidden it in many places and we are not able to find part of it, or we have written it on paper and it is not completely readable anymore, etc.</p>
<p>With Anu₿itux we can try to solve this issue with <a href="https://github.com/gurnec/btcrecover/blob/master/docs/Seedrecover_Quick_Start_Guide.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seedrecover.py</a>, a tool that comes with <a href="https://btcrecover.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">btcrecover.py</a>. To start it we only need to type seedrecover.py in our Terminal. It has a very simple to use graphical user interface and we only need to answer the prompted question and skip the unavailable information.</p>
<p>Let's check out how it works in a couple of use cases. For the examples we are going to use the following seed, obtained with the <a href="https://iancoleman.io/bip39/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ian Coleman's BIP39 tool</a>.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_007.png" alt="seed" width="800" height="499" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_007-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_007-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_007-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_007-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_007-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_007-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<h3>Case 1: missing words</h3>
<p>Let's hypothesize that we have only the first ten words of our seed:</p>
<p><code>rigid cool hire tiny kingdom inner evidence brown fee airport</code></p>
<p>First of all let's start our tool.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_008.png" alt="" width="700" height="688" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_008-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_008-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_008-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_008-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_008-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_008-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>The tool asks us if we have a wallet file related to our mnemonic seed, but this is not our case so let's skip this question by clicking on the "Cancel" button.</p>
<p>Now we need to choose the kind of wallet we are going to recover, in our case a Bitcoin wallet with BIP39-based words.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_009.png" alt="" width="700" height="721" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_009-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_009-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_009-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_009-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_009-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_009-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>The tool only supports BIP44-derived addresses. This information will be used further by the tool because it will check if the seed is correct by comparing many derived addresses with the one we have to provide. If our seed has been used with a multicurrency wallet like Exodus or Coinomi, we can choose a coin from which we know at least one public address derived from the seed we are trying to recover.</p>
<p>In the next step, the tool is going to ask us if we know a master key of our wallet, but this is not our case, so let's skip this step by clicking on the "Cancel" button.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_010.png" alt="" width="800" height="140" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_010-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_010-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_010-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_010-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_010-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_010-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Now we can provide at least one address derived from our mnemonic seed.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_014.png" alt="" width="1000" height="626" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_014-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_014-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_014-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_014-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_014-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_014-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>It is important to provide addresses obtained with a BIP44 derivation path. This path is commonly used by all the currency but coins like Bitcoin, Litecoin, etc, also support other derivation paths like BIP49 and BIP84.</p>
<p>Now the tool asks us to decide how many addresses we want to be checked for each possible mnemonic seed. If we know the address we have provided is one of the firsts derived, we can provide a low number like 10. Unless so, the tool could take longer to check a lot of possible mnemonic seeds.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_015.png" alt="" width="350" height="181" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_015-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_015-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_015-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_015-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_015-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_015-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Finally, we have to provide the part of the mnemonic seed we have available.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_016.png" alt="" width="350" height="139" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_016-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_016-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_016-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_016-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_016-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_016-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Now we can click on the "OK" button and wait until the tool tries to find the correct mnemonic seed.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_017-2.png" alt="" width="700" height="477" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_017-2-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_017-2-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_017-2-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_017-2-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_017-2-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_017-2-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>After a while, the tool will be able to provide us the correct seed.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_018.png" alt="seedfound" width="900" height="639" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_018-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_018-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_018-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_018-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_018-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_018-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<h3>Case 2: wrong words</h3>
<p>Let's now hypothesize we have all the 12 words of our mnemonic seed but for some reason, we are not able to read one of them. So, instead of having the seed</p>
<p><code>rigid cool hire tiny kingdom inner evidence brown fee airport grant orient</code></p>
<p>we have</p>
<p><code>rigid cool hive tiny kingdom inner evidence brown fee airport grant orient</code></p>
<p>In this case, we can follow the same steps we have seed above and, when the tool asks us to enter the best guess for our mnemonic seed, we can insert this sequence of words.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/Selection_041.png" alt="" width="380" height="149" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/Selection_041-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/Selection_041-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/Selection_041-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/Selection_041-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/Selection_041-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/Selection_041-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>In this case, in a few seconds, the tool is able to provide us the correct mnemonic seed!</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/Selection_043.png" alt="" width="900" height="461" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/Selection_043-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/Selection_043-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/Selection_043-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/Selection_043-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/Selection_043-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/Selection_043-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<h3>Final thoughts</h3>
<p>We have seen some simple applications of this tool but, of course, it could also perform harder tasks. For example, it could fix a mnemonic seed with both missing and wrong words. It is important that we do not know only the mnemonic seed we are trying to fix but also at least one other piece of information like our extended public key, one or more addresses or the wallet file the seed is related to. We also need to know the correct derivation path used with the mnemonic seed.</p>
