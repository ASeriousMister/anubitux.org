                    <p><img src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/61/domino-g9b2cd8d8d_1920.jpg" class="type:primaryImage" alt="" /></p>
                <p>Creating a mnemonic phrase is a very sensitive operation that can be done in a lot of different ways. No one of them can be considered absolutely better than the others, we can only try to find out which one fits our needs in the best way. We need to create it safely and store it in secure ways since it can be used to recover access to all the related private keys.</p>
<h3>What is a mnemonic phrase made of?</h3>
<p>A m<a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nemonic phrase</a> looks like a random sequence of words but it's not that easy. These words are taken from pre-established ordered <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/tree/master/bip-0039" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wordlists</a>, containing 2048 words. The last word of the list can't be a random one because it works as a checksum and helps us to verify that our phrase is correct.</p>
<p>Going deeper, our mnemonic seed represents our seed, which is made by a sequence of bits obtained joining our entropy with the checksum. Every word of the list represents an 11-bit sequence corresponding to the decimal value of the index of the word in the list. The last 11 bits, concerning to the last word of the mnemonic seed are made by the last part of the entropy and the checksum. So the last word needs to be chosen respecting the checksum obtained from our entropy.</p>
<h3>How is the checksum calculated?</h3>
<p>The checksum is obtained by taking a bit of the Sha256 hash of our entropy every 32 bits of entropy. So, for instance, with 128 bits of entropy we will have a 4 bits checksum (128/32=4). The first 121 bits of entropy (11*11=121) will always correspond to the same 11 words. The last word's index is made by the last seven bits of entropy and the checksum. So, as these 7 bits change, we will obtain a different checksum and a different last word for our mnemonic phrase.</p>
<p class="msg msg--info">We also discussed mnemonic phrases in <a href="https://anubitux.org/how-to-generate-a-mnemonic-seed-with-anubitux-and-a-dice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this post</a>. </p>
<h3>How to obtain the last word</h3>
<p>Let's assume we obtained the first words of our mnemonic phrase in a way we consider secure and safe according to our needs. Now we need to obtain the last word to have a complete mnemonic phrase but we may not be able to calculate the Sha256 value of our entropy and convert it to bits. Anu₿itux helps us with the <a href="https://github.com/ASeriousMister/LastWord" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lastword.py</a> tool!</p>
<p class="msg msg--warning">To use it in a safe way we are supposed to run it in a live session of Anu₿itux disabling all the network features with the proper desktop shortcut!</p>
<p>To run it we can type</p>
<p class="align-center"><code>lastword.py</code></p>
<p>in our terminal window and follow the prompted questions.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/61/lw1.png" alt="" width="730" height="493" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/61/responsive/lw1-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/61/responsive/lw1-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/61/responsive/lw1-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/61/responsive/lw1-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/61/responsive/lw1-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/61/responsive/lw1-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Now we can select how many words we have in our mnemonic phrase and the language of the wordlist we used.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/61/lw2.png" alt="" width="730" height="486" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/61/responsive/lw2-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/61/responsive/lw2-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/61/responsive/lw2-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/61/responsive/lw2-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/61/responsive/lw2-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/61/responsive/lw2-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Now we can provide the first words we obtained with our secure method.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/61/lw3.png" alt="" width="730" height="490" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/61/responsive/lw3-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/61/responsive/lw3-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/61/responsive/lw3-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/61/responsive/lw3-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/61/responsive/lw3-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/61/responsive/lw3-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>The tool is showing us the corresponding index of each word, so we can also check that we selected them correctly.</p>
<p>Now the tool will add some securely generated random bits to our entropy to reach the correct length. Then it will calculate the checksum and provide us our mnemonic phrase.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/61/lw4.png" alt="" width="730" height="491" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/61/responsive/lw4-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/61/responsive/lw4-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/61/responsive/lw4-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/61/responsive/lw4-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/61/responsive/lw4-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/61/responsive/lw4-2xl.png 1600w"> </figure>
<h3>Final thoughts</h3>
<p>Creating a mnemonic phrase has to be done very carefully since it is very hard to realize it has been compromised before we are losing all our coins.</p>
<p>This tool is just another solution to help users to create mnemonics in a secure and simple way. We do not have to forget that we also need to pay attention to the way we are storing it. Even in this case, there isn't a universal solution. If we need to access often our mnemonic to sign transactions it should be in a secure but accessible place or if we use it as a disaster recovery strategy, it can be stored in a very hard to reach place.</p>
<p>We should not look for the best strategy but we should seek the knowledge that will allow us to decide which strategy is the best for us.</p>

                    <p><img src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/fractal-g413a8f627_1920.jpg" class="type:primaryImage" alt="" /></p>
                <p>When handling our cryptocurrencies, we feel more comfortable being offline but, sometimes, we can't perform operations without using an internet connection. In these cases, we are always afraid that some sensible information could be leaked. With Anu₿itux we have a lot of countermeasures, like a <a href="https://anubitux.org/enable-network-monitor-in-anubitux-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">network monitor</a> on the lower right side of our screen and a desktop shortcut that disables all the communication features. If we want to perform some additional checks, even to verify if Anu₿itux is working properly, we can use <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wireshark</a>, a tool that captures all the incoming and outgoing network traffic and allows us to review it with a lot of powerful features like filters and streams reconstruction.</p>
<h3>First steps</h3>
<p>We can find wireshark in the Useful Tools menu. If we want to run it with root privileges, we can launch it from our terminal typing</p>
<p class="align-center"><code>sudo wireshark</code></p>
<p>Remember that in Anu₿itux the default root password is set to anubitux.</p>
<p>Now we can choose which network interface we want packets to be captured and start the acquisition by clicking on the shark's fin button.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/Selection_161.png" alt="" width="740" height="575" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_161-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_161-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_161-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_161-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_161-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_161-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<h3>Decrypting encrypted network traffic</h3>
<p>Nowadays most of the network traffic is encrypted with TLS, so even if we capture it, we won't be able to read it. To see what's flowing through our Internet connection, we need to configure a <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/27131/differences-between-the-terms-pre-master-secret-master-secret-private-key" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pre-master secret key</a>.</p>
<p>To prepare it, we need to set up an environment variable, setting up a file that stores handshakes and that can be used by Wireshark to decrypt network traffic.</p>
<p>Let's create an empty text file, for instance in our Documents folder and name it keylogfile.txt. Now we need to edit the SSLKEYLOGFILE environment variable so that the information we need will be stored in this file. We can do that by opening our terminal and typing </p>
<p class="align-center"><code>nano .bashrc</code></p>
<p>and adding this line at the end of the file</p>
<p class="align-center"><code>export SSLKEYLOGFILE=/home/anubitux/Documents/keylogfile.txt</code></p>
<p>Then we can close the nano text editor pressing Ctrl+X and saving the modified file (without renaming it).</p>
<p>Now we need to restart our Terminal so that it takes effect. To check if it worked, we can type</p>
<p class="align-center"><code>echo $SSLKEYLOGFILE</code></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/Selection_162.png" alt="" width="390" height="66" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_162-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_162-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_162-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_162-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_162-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_162-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>At this point we have to set up Wireshark to use the content of this file to decrypt the captured network traffic. To do that we have to open Wireshark, go to Edit and click on Preferences, then under the protocols list select TLS and, clicking on the Browse button, provide the keylogfile we created.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/Selection_163.png" alt="" width="740" height="578" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_163-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_163-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_163-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_163-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_163-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_163-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Now Wireshark will be able to decrypt network traffic and show it in plain text.</p>
<h3>Capturing traffic</h3>
<p>Finally, we can start capturing our traffic by clicking on the shark's fin button. To see something going on, let's start the Firefox browser (it may be necessary to start it from the Terminal, to make sure it stores keys in the keylogfile.txt file).</p>
<p>Then we can visit some websites that use HTTPS, like anubitux.org and iancoleman.io. After browsing some pages we can stop the network capture and review it.</p>
<p>In the below picture, we can see an example with a captured TLS packet.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/Selection_164.png" alt="" width="930" height="826" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_164-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_164-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_164-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_164-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_164-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_164-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>To see its content we need to click on the proper button in the lower part of the user interface. These buttons would not be available without setting up the key log file as we did before.</p>
<p>In this case, it is a packet related to the HTTPS certificate verification process. With most of the websites, even if packets are unencrypted, we won't see the plain text because the information are sent in gzip format. Sometimes Wireshark will be able to see it, providing us another button to see the uncompressed content of packets.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/Selection_165.png" alt="" width="570" height="71" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_165-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_165-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_165-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_165-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_165-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_165-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>If we are interested in packets we exchanged with a specific website, like iancoleman.io, we can filter our list knowing its IP address. To check it out we can ping it, as seen above.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/Selection_166.png" alt="" width="730" height="261" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_166-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_166-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_166-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_166-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_166-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_166-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Now we can set up filters in the proper box, based on the IP address we have found. To see both incoming and outgoing traffic the syntax is</p>
<p class="align-center"><code>ip.src == 99.86.159.30 or ip.dst == 99.86.159.30</code></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/Selection_167.png" alt="" width="910" height="827" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_167-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_167-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_167-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_167-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_167-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_167-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>In the picture we can see a packet we have sent to iancoleman.io's website with the details of our browser. It was an encrypted package and we can see its content only thanks to the setup we have made.</p>
<h3>Final thoughts</h3>
<p>Wireshark is a very powerful tool to analyze network traffic. In this post, we have seen only a few examples of how to use it but it can be applied in a lot of different situations, not only for analyzing network activity but also for penetration testing and security audits. It also requires very good skills to be used properly, since it collects thousands of packets every few seconds and most of them seem to be meaningless without knowing what is going on. There are a lot of guides and tutorials online about how to use it, even on the official <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/#learnWS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>. </p>

                <p>After having broadly reviewed what we could call the <a href="https://anubitux.org/from-wax-tablets-to-elliptical-curves-a-brief-history-of-cryptography-part-one/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">genesis of cryptography</a>, in this second article we will take us far forward in time, up to the present day.</p>
<p>With the advent of modern electronic computers, it has been possible to exploit the computational power of processors in order to automate the procedures for coding and decoding messages.</p>
<p>Conceptually, even though centuries have passed, we still think in terms of algorithm, which represents the cryptographic method, and key, a string chosen by the user useful for encrypting and decrypting the message.</p>
<p>A substantial difference with respect to the past is given by the fact that electronic computers use only binary numbers as inputs, i.e., the numbers 0 and 1, with the combination of which all the other numbers, letters and symbols are composed. In particular, for the formation of the alphabet a conversion method called ASCII is used which allows to represent up to 128 alphabetic and symbolic characters through the combination of 7 binary digits.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the introduction of block encryption algorithms has made it possible to speed up the encryption/decryption processes by allowing the algorithm to be applied no longer to single elements, but to entire blocks of elements (composed of N bits), on which it is It is possible to carry out different types of operations, called iterations or rounds which, performed in sequence on each block processed, will lead to a greater or lesser complexity of the encryption algorithm.</p>
<p>Since the 1970s, together with the diffusion of personal computers, there has been great attention to the development of new encryption methods, which guarantee the best compromise between the level of security achieved and the complexity in computational terms of the algorithm adopted. The first of these was created by the German Horst Feistel (German naturalized US cryptographer who worked at IBM on the development of several famous ciphers) who, with his Lucifer cipher , laid the foundations for the Data Encryption Standard (called DES ) first protocol cipher officially adopted by the National Bureau of Standards of the United States ( National Institute of Standards and Technology, an agency of the government of the United States of America that deals with the management of technologies, today NIST ) in order to encrypt documents containing sensitive information ( a brief explanation of DES is available in <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.197.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this NIST document</a>).</p>
<p>After a few years, despite the improvements made over time, the DES protocol was supplanted by the more performing and secure Advanced Encryption Standard (= AES ) which, with its 128-bit blocks, could use 128, 192 or 256-bit keys and which , therefore, has been adopted by NIST to encrypt documents classified even as Top Secret (on <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.197.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this NIST page</a> an excellent presentation of the AES algorithm).</p>
<h3>Symmetric encryption and public key encryption</h3>
<p>After these very brief references, which I hope to have allowed us to understand how and why we have passed from an analogical to a digital encryption method, it would be appropriate to focus our attention on the functioning of some of them.</p>
<p>Among the encryption methods currently most used in the IT environment, a substantial distinction could be made based on the type of key used: symmetric key encryption and public key encryption.</p>
<p>In the first case, the key to encrypt and the one to decrypt will coincide, in the second case, however, it will be necessary to use two different keys (even if "linked" to each other).</p>
<p>One of the major problems of the first encryption methods, such as DES or AES, just mentioned, consisted in the need to create a rather long key, so as to be reasonably sure that the computational capabilities of the computers could not perform a so-called brute attack force, which is a method that consists of trying all possible combinations of keys. If it is true that it is possible to minimize this risk by simply increasing the length of the encryption key, so as to exponentially increase the calculation times and make a brute-force attack very difficult (if not impossible even with current hardware devices), one must however consider that the main flaw of the symmetric key method was the extreme difficulty in communicating the key to the recipient in a secure way.</p>
<p>This delicate step has been the Achilles' heel of encryption methods of this type for decades, prompting some scholars to look for one that would allow the sender and recipient of the message to communicate in total security.</p>
<p>In fact, there was a piece of history still to be written in cryptography. The moment this dilemma was resolved, a profound revolution would have taken place, in cryptography in particular, but also more generally in the methods of communication believed to be secure until then.</p>
<p>This epochal discovery took place in the 70s in America, developing the intuition had by the mathematicians Hellman, Diffie and Merkle according to which it was possible to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">exchange unencrypted values ​​useful for generating one's own encryption keys</a>, thanks to the use of functions called unidirectional , i.e. via non-reversible functions.</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards, thanks to the application of other scholars and cryptography enthusiasts such as Rivest, Shamir and Adleman , the cryptography system considered since then among the most important and innovative of this branch of science was developed: the RSA system (<a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/Rsapaper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here the paper</a>), also known as the public key cryptography system.</p>
<p>The innovative idea consisted in the presence of two different keys, one public, used to encrypt the message, the other private, used to decrypt it. This was made possible thanks to the use of a special one-way function, i.e., a function that was normally very difficult to reverse except under certain conditions (=the use of the private key).</p>
<p>In practice, to use this encryption, each user should have two keys, first of all creating a private key, to be jealously guarded, then deriving a public key from it. This key, as explained by the name itself, is not secret, on the contrary, for the purpose of correct encryption it is necessary to communicate it to the sender of the message, who will use it to encrypt his message thus sending it to the recipient without the worry of having to communicate the key, with the risks that would derive from it. Once the message has been delivered, for example via email, the recipient just has to decrypt the message using his own private key, the only one capable of inverting the special one-way function that underlies this method.</p>
<p>The classic example reported in scientific literature wants Alice and Bob to be willing to exchange a text message. Alice asks Bob for her public key, and Bob sends it to her. Using Bob's public key, Alice can encrypt the message and can proceed to send it. Once Bob has received the message, he can decrypt it using his private key.</p>
<p>In reality, the function used to implement this method is defined as unidirectional, but this does not mean that it is completely irreversible since, through factoring, it is possible to try to go back to the prime numbers used for the implementation of this cryptographic system, even if it is extremely expensive in terms of computational power. To overcome this type of problem, the use of keys that are at least 2048 bits long is now recommended.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://www.usna.edu/Users/cs/wcbrown/courses/si110AY13S/lec/l26/lec.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this page</a> you will find an explanation of this algorithm, even with some small illustrations that can facilitate understanding 😊. </p>
<p>For fans of numbers and mathematical problems, I recommend reading the book <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Xfermat-S-Last-Theorem-Pb/dp/0007902492" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fermat's Last Theorem</a>. The adventure of a genius, of a mathematical problem and of the man who solved it (I inserted the link on Amazon for simplicity's sake, but you can find it everywhere, even in any traditional bookstore) once again by Simon Singh, who managed to make a topic in itself difficult exciting, and moreover he succeeded in the huge aim of making me read an enormous amount of figures without me being bored!</p>
<h3>Hash functions</h3>
<p>Taking up the concept of non-invertible function described above, it will be easier at this point to introduce the concept of hash, since it is based on a one-way function, simple to compute but (hopefully) impossible to invert.</p>
<p>The purpose of this algorithm is to reduce a text (or input) of arbitrary length into a string (called hash value or message digest) of a fixed length.</p>
<p>Moreover, in addition to non-reversibility, therefore the impossibility of going back to the initial message starting from the hash value, this function must respect other important characteristics:</p>
<p>    • must produce a string that always has the same length regardless of the size of the input;<br>    • it must allow that, if the hashing function is repeated on the same message, the same output value is always calculated;<br>    • finally, it must ensure that at the slightest change in the input, the algorithm returns a completely different hash value.</p>
<p>The most used hashing protocols are: the MD5 algorithm , one of the first algorithms used for this purpose, very fast and still used to check the integrity of files; the family of SHA algorithms offers an increasing safety factor, the best known are SHA-1 and SHA-256 ; the series of RIPEMD algorithms , the best known of which is the RIPEMD-160, born as a European response to the American MD5 algorithm.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://md5calc.com/hash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this address</a> we can have fun calculating the hash value for any portion of text and for files up to 10 MB, using numerous hashing algorithms.</p>
<p>The applications of such a function are many and more widespread than one might imagine. A first example of the use of hashing functions are password databases, where passwords are saved in the form of hash values ​​in order to prevent malicious people who come into possession of them from going back to the real passwords. </p>
<p>Another example would be file integrity checking, where you use the hash value as a checksum to make sure a particular file has not changed.</p>
<p>It is possible to verify the integrity of a message, by comparing the hash value calculated before and after the transmission of the message and verifying that no one has altered the source code since, due to the properties of this function, a minimal variation of the input would cause a complete hash value change. A useful application of this feature is the comparison with pre-compiled hash lists, in order to be able to quickly search for files already registered as viruses or containing malware in general.</p>
<p>Also, in computer forensics the hash function is widely used, in order to preserve the data that is acquired from any type of alteration or manipulation, allowing a rapid integrity check at any time. All data that is duplicated for forensic activities, in fact, assumes validity only if their congruence with the original data is verified.</p>
<p>For those who have never heard of computer forensics, I quote a very comprehensive definition:</p>
<p>“Forensic computer science is the discipline that studies the research, identification, collection, preservation, acquisition, analysis, presentation and evaluation of computer data for evidentiary purposes, in the context of criminal or civil procedural law. The science of computer forensics unfolds in different sectors of technology in order to allow the computer expert to acquire and analyse different types of devices and data.”.</p>

<p>Any digital element can be used as an input value for a hash function. A string of text, an image, an audio file, an entire hard disk or any other digital data can "pass" through a specific hash function, returning a digest that will always have the same length, based on the algorithm used.</p>
<p>A few brief examples will undoubtedly offer an overview of the above concept, making the characteristics and utility of hash functions immediately identifiable. In particular, for such examples, the SHA-1 algorithm was used:</p>

</figure>
<p>Note how, as a single character in the input value varies between the two examples above (replacing the final punctuation mark of the example in Fig. 1 with an exclamation mark of the input value in Fig. 2), the result obtained was completely different.</p>
<p>In the same way, it will be easy to observe that, using a much longer text as input, the hash function always returns a value of the same length (the SHA-1 algorithm, taken for example, generates a message digest with a length of 160 bits, represented with 40 characters in hexadecimal value):</p>

</figure>
<h3>Digital signature</h3>
<p>A further application of public key cryptography, coupled with the characteristics of the hash algorithm, was the introduction of the so-called digital signature.</p>
<p>We have already seen that, given a document with content of arbitrary length, it is possible to reduce it to a string using the hash function. This string can be encrypted with the sender's private key, reversing the usual order. At this point, the document is ready to be sent unencrypted to the recipient, together with the digital signature and the sender's public key. The receiver, in turn, using the public key received from the sender, will be able to be certain that the message is authentic and also, by calculating the hash value, that no one has been able to make changes to the original message.</p>
<p>The following diagram will be useful in order to better understand what steps are necessary to apply the Digital Signature to a document:</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center" ><img loading="lazy" src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/57/firma-digitale.png" alt="" width="680" height="674" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/57/responsive/firma-digitale-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/57/responsive/firma-digitale-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/57/responsive/firma-digitale-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/57/responsive/firma-digitale-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/57/responsive/firma-digitale-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/57/responsive/firma-digitale-2xl.png 1600w">
<figcaption >Fig. 4: Operation diagram of the Digital Signature</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In recent years, the digital signature has been widely used as well as further implemented, including through the use of smart cards, so as to assume a central role in digital communications, especially in the Public Administration. With D.Lgs. 82/2005, followed by D.Lgs. 235/2010, the Code for Digital Administration was introduced into Italian legislation, a body of rules with which the utmost importance was given to digital communications in the Public Administration, elevating the digital signature to a signature completely similar to the handwritten one (as indicated in article 21, paragraph 2, of Decreto Legislativo 7 marzo 2005, n. 82, published in the “Gazzetta Ufficiale” n. 112 of 16/05/2005).<br>Also in the Bitcoin protocol the developers have used the digital signature, together with the hash function, to digitally sign the transactions and verify that they originate from the real sender, but we will talk about this in the third and final part.</p>

<h5>What is Anu₿itux for?</h5>
<p>Anu₿itux is a customized Linux distribution based on Debian. It is designed to work as a live environment and aims to provide a safe and simple solution to use and manage cryptocurrency wallets, even for non-experienced users.</p>
<h5>What is the default user password?</h5>
<p>Anu₿itux has a default user that is <strong>anubitux</strong> and its password is <strong>anubitux</strong>. The user anubitux was added to the sudoers so it is possible to run commands that need root privileges.</p>
<h5>How to set up root password in Anu₿itux?</h5>
<p>Some actions, like autentication on some Wi-Fi network could need a root password to be performed. The user anubitux is in the sudoers but its password will not be accepted as a root password. To solve this simply run</p>
<p><code>sudo passwd</code></p>
<p>in your terminal and chose a password. If you are using Anu₿itux in live mode, this password will not be stored anywhere and has to be set-up again at every reboot.</p>
<h5>How to use Anu₿itux?</h5>
<p>Anu₿itux has beed designed to work as a live environment or, only for training purposes, as an installable Linux distribution that can be used as a virtual machine or on a dedicated device. To run it, please refer to <a href="https://anubitux.org/how-to-use-anubitux-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this post</a>.</p>
<h5>Anu₿itux does not start, what should I do?</h5>
<p>Some devices could not be able to run live Linux distros properly. Anu₿itux integrates a lot of firmwares and drivers but sometimes this is not enough. When starting, operating systems check the available hardware and power settings with a standard named ACPI. On some devices this check fails and the system does not start. To avoid this issue it is enough to disable this check. On the boot screen, when "Live (amd64)" is selected hit e to edit the grub config, after "quiet splasc" write acpi=off and hit enter (do not worry if line splits). Now hit Ctrl + X to boot.</p>
<h5>How to verify Anu₿itux?</h5>
<p>Every time a new release of Anu₿itux is released, checksums are updated on the <a href="https://anubitux.org/download-anubitux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">download page</a>. They are signen with our PGP key that we share on our <a href="https://github.com/ASeriousMister/Anubitux-PGP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>, on <a href="https://pastebin.com/bqmy9y2P" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PasteBin</a> and on <a href="https://keybase.io/anubitux" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KeyBase</a>. To verify the signed checksums, please refer to <a href="https://anubitux.org/how-to-verify-your-downloaded-anubitux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this post</a>.</p>
<h5>How to verify Anu₿itux's tools?</h5>
<p>Anu₿itux's tools have been downloaded from the official debian reposotpries, from GitHub or as .appimage from the officla websites. GitHub tools and .appimages are placed in the /home/anubitux/Tools/ directory. Users can verify the source of the tools like Python scripts and verify checksums of the appimages comparing them to the official webisites of the tools. Doing so, users do not need to trust Anu₿itux but can easily verify by themselves that the Tools are genuine. All the links to sources and official websites can be found <a href="https://anubitux.org/what-is-anubitux-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<h5>How to update Anu₿itux?</h5>
<p>Anu₿itux works primarly as a live envirnment. Running commands like sudo apt update or sudo apt upgrade will have effect only on the current session and will not affect appimages and open source tools. The only way to update Anu₿itux is to <a href="https://anubitux.org/download-anubitux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">download</a> the last version checking the <a href="https://anubitux.org/changelog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">changelog</a>. We are releasing frequently a new version of Anu₿itux containing updates, some fixes and including users' <a href="https://anubitux.org/meet-the-anubitux-project/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">suggestions</a>.</p>
<h5>What should I do if I do not know how Anu₿itux's tools work?</h5>
<p>One of the main rules in the crypto world is "do not trust, verify!". Anu₿itux uses open source tools that can be verified by yourself or by someone you trust and appimages, so that you can verify the checksum of the tools by yourself referencing to the official sites. Link to sources and official websites can be found on <a href="https://anubitux.org/what-is-anubitux-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this page</a>. If you are in doubt about any tool or feature do not hesitate to <a href="https://anubitux.org/meet-the-anubitux-project/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contact us</a>.</p>

                <p>Anu₿itux is a linux distro based on Debian. By default, Anu₿itux has the network monitor enabled in the lower panel, but, it could not show any data because it needs to be configured accordingly to the network interfaces of the device you are using.</p>
<p>To make it work properly, right click on the right part of the lower panel, near the notification area, as shown below.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/53/Selection_128.png" alt="" width="470" height="289" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/53/responsive/Selection_128-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/53/responsive/Selection_128-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/53/responsive/Selection_128-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/53/responsive/Selection_128-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/53/responsive/Selection_128-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/53/responsive/Selection_128-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Then click on Network interfaces and select the interfaces you want to be monitored, to show the inbound and outbound network traffic on your panel and always be able to see if something is going on.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/53/Selection_129.png" alt="" width="470" height="321" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/53/responsive/Selection_129-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/53/responsive/Selection_129-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/53/responsive/Selection_129-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/53/responsive/Selection_129-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/53/responsive/Selection_129-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/53/responsive/Selection_129-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Now you will be able to see two coloured waves on the panel that symbolize the network load.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/53/Selection_130.png" alt="" width="298" height="90" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/53/responsive/Selection_130-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/53/responsive/Selection_130-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/53/responsive/Selection_130-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/53/responsive/Selection_130-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/53/responsive/Selection_130-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/53/responsive/Selection_130-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>This feature is very userful to notice if a service or a tool is doing some unexpected network traffic.</p>

                <p>On the web there is a lot of tutorials about how to use iso files containing Linux distributions or about how to import a virtual appliance in softwares like <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VirtualBox</a>, so, here's another one. Of course, users may use any preferred and known solutions. These are only suggestions diirected to those who are not used to this type of files.</p>
<p>After you have <a href="https://anubitux.org/download-anubitux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">downloaded</a> the preferred version of Anu₿itux, please refer to the corresponding section of this page to start using it.</p>
<h3>Anu₿itux Live</h3>
<p>This is the main version of the Anu₿itux distro, designed to provide a safe environment and leave no traces on the devices used to run it. To use it, you'll need a USB stick and a software to flash the .iso file on it and make it bootable. For this purpose, we suggest <a href="https://www.balena.io/etcher/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Balena Etcher</a> which works on any kind of operative system, but there are many different solutions like <a href="https://rufus.ie/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rufus</a> for Windows or <a href="https://unetbootin.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UNetbootin</a> for different OSes.</p>
<p>When using Balena Etcher, there is a very easy wizard to follow.</p>
<p>First of all plug in your USB stick and then click on the Flash from file" and select the .iso file you want to have on your USB stick.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/Screenshot-at-2022-06-30-12-23-51.png" alt="Etcher1" width="819" height="526" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/responsive/Screenshot-at-2022-06-30-12-23-51-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/responsive/Screenshot-at-2022-06-30-12-23-51-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/responsive/Screenshot-at-2022-06-30-12-23-51-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/responsive/Screenshot-at-2022-06-30-12-23-51-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/responsive/Screenshot-at-2022-06-30-12-23-51-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/responsive/Screenshot-at-2022-06-30-12-23-51-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Then click on the "Select target" button and choose your USB stick. Do not forget that this process will overwrite all the content of the used drive, so, if needed, backup your files before completing this process.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/Screenshot-at-2022-06-30-12-27-54.png" alt="Etcher2" width="819" height="526" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/responsive/Screenshot-at-2022-06-30-12-27-54-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/responsive/Screenshot-at-2022-06-30-12-27-54-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/responsive/Screenshot-at-2022-06-30-12-27-54-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/responsive/Screenshot-at-2022-06-30-12-27-54-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/responsive/Screenshot-at-2022-06-30-12-27-54-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/responsive/Screenshot-at-2022-06-30-12-27-54-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Now click on the "Flash!" button (if using Linux provide your root password) and wait until the process ends.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/Screenshot-at-2022-06-30-12-32-23.png" alt="etcher3" width="819" height="526" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/responsive/Screenshot-at-2022-06-30-12-32-23-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/responsive/Screenshot-at-2022-06-30-12-32-23-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/responsive/Screenshot-at-2022-06-30-12-32-23-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/responsive/Screenshot-at-2022-06-30-12-32-23-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/responsive/Screenshot-at-2022-06-30-12-32-23-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/responsive/Screenshot-at-2022-06-30-12-32-23-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>When finished, you can plug in the USB stick to the device you want to use with Anu₿itux and turn it on.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/Screenshot-at-2022-06-30-12-38-04.png" alt="etcher4" width="819" height="526" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/responsive/Screenshot-at-2022-06-30-12-38-04-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/responsive/Screenshot-at-2022-06-30-12-38-04-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/responsive/Screenshot-at-2022-06-30-12-38-04-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/responsive/Screenshot-at-2022-06-30-12-38-04-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/responsive/Screenshot-at-2022-06-30-12-38-04-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/responsive/Screenshot-at-2022-06-30-12-38-04-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Now you may need to enter your BIOS configuration and change the boot priority so that the USB device will be in the first position. Unless so, your device may boot your common operating system. In some cases, to change boot priority you may need to disable the secure boot features or change the boot mode settings. This procedure may be different depending on the used device. <a href="https://www.acronis.com/en-us/blog/posts/usb-boot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here</a> you can find some useful suggestions about how to do that.</p>
<p>When your device boots from the USB drive containing Anu₿itux, we have to chose the Live (amd64) option tu run it in in Live mode and leave no traces on our device about what we are doing, unless we want.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/Selection_116.png" alt="" width="600" height="451" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/responsive/Selection_116-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/responsive/Selection_116-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/responsive/Selection_116-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/responsive/Selection_116-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/responsive/Selection_116-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/responsive/Selection_116-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<h3>Anu₿itux install</h3>
<p>We could need to install Anu₿itux, maybe to run some tests on the tools or do some training with them. To install it on a dedicated device, we can arrange an USB drive following the steps shown above and, when booting from it, we have to chose the Start installer option.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/Selection_117.png" alt="" width="640" height="477" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/responsive/Selection_117-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/responsive/Selection_117-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/responsive/Selection_117-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/responsive/Selection_117-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/responsive/Selection_117-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/responsive/Selection_117-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Now we have to follow the debian installation wizard.</p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight "><strong>It is suggested to chose anubitux as username, to be sure that all the tools run properly.</strong></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/Selezione_108.png" alt="" width="800" height="594" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/responsive/Selezione_108-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/responsive/Selezione_108-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/responsive/Selezione_108-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/responsive/Selezione_108-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/responsive/Selezione_108-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/responsive/Selezione_108-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>When arriving at the step where we have to chose the root password, we can leave it blank, so that our user will automatically be allowed to run administrative commands with sudo, and have a more "<em>ubuntu-like</em>" user experience.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/Selection_109.png" alt="" width="790" height="512" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/responsive/Selection_109-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/responsive/Selection_109-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/responsive/Selection_109-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/responsive/Selection_109-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/responsive/Selection_109-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/responsive/Selection_109-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>We may also install it in a virtual machine like <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VirtualBox</a> or <a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VMWare Player</a>.</p>
<h5>VIrtualBox</h5>
<p>First of all create a new virtual machine (Machine -&gt; New) and fill the form as preferred or like suggested in the following picture, providing the iso file of Anu₿itux.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/Selection_118-2.png" alt="" width="800" height="483" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/responsive/Selection_118-2-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/responsive/Selection_118-2-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/responsive/Selection_118-2-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/responsive/Selection_118-2-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/responsive/Selection_118-2-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/responsive/Selection_118-2-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>It is very important to check the "Skip Unattended Installation" option, to avoid running issues due to some wrong configuration that VirtualBox could automatically make.</p>
<p>In the next step we have to assing the resources to our virtual machine. This depends on the host machine we are using to run the VM.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/Selection_119.png" alt="" width="800" height="484" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/responsive/Selection_119-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/responsive/Selection_119-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/responsive/Selection_119-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/responsive/Selection_119-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/responsive/Selection_119-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/52/responsive/Selection_119-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Then we have to chose the size of the virtual drive: 20 GB should be enough.</p>

                    <p><img src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/Golde_Eye.png" class="type:primaryImage" alt="" /></p>
                <p>Let's hypothesize we arranged our super secure cold storage to "hodl" cryptos until they get to the moon, maybe using one of our tools like <a href="https://anubitux.org/how-to-generate-random-paper-wallets-with-anubitux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dicetracker</a> or <a href="https://anubitux.org/how-to-generate-a-mnemonic-seed-with-anubitux-and-a-dice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dice2seed</a>! It could be very useful to be able to monitor our addresses, not only to see how we are getting to the moon but also to be sure that our funds are safe and our cold storage is working properly. To do that, of course, we could take note of our public addresses and check them periodically on some block explorer. We can find a lot of them in Firefox's bookmarks in Anu₿itux. To perform this task in a better way, we could arrange a view-only wallet, a wallet that is only able to see what's going on with our addresses but does not know our private keys so that it will be unable to sign transactions and spend our funds.</p>
<p class="msg msg--warning"><strong>Never send or request funds to addresses that are in our view-only wallets if we are not sure to be able to access the corresponding private keys!</strong></p>
<h3>Bitcoin watching-only wallet</h3>
<p>With Bitcoin addresses, one of the best tools to arrange a watching-only wallet is <a href="https://electrum.org/#home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Electrum</a>. We could arrange it using public addresses or master public keys, depending on how we created our cold storage.</p>
<p class="msg msg--info">OPSEC TIP: wallets like the ones proposed in this post are called SPV wallets. They use other's nodes to check our balances. If available, we should set up our clients to connect only to trusted nodes (we will discuss it in further posts, keep following us).</p>
<h4>Public addresses</h4>
<p>In the first case, let's hypothesize we took note of our public addresses and would like to monitor them comfortably through Electrum. To do that let's start Electrum from the Wallets menu in Anu₿itux and create a new wallet, selecting the "Import Bitcoin addresses or private keys" option.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/Selection_086.png" alt="" width="600" height="425" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_086-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_086-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_086-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_086-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_086-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_086-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>In the next step, we can type or paste our public addresses in the proper box.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/Selection_087.png" alt="" width="600" height="431" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_087-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_087-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_087-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_087-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_087-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_087-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Now, clicking on next, we can provide a password and then we will have our watching-only wallet.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/Selection_088.png" alt="" width="600" height="404" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_088-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_088-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_088-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_088-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_088-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_088-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<h4>Electrum Master Public Key</h4>
<p>If we created our seed using Electrum, maybe using the advanced feature to obtain a <a href="https://anubitux.org/how-to-generate-24-words-mnemonic-seeds-with-electrum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">24 words mnemonic seed phrase</a>, we could obtain our master public key and use it to set up a new watching-only wallet. Using master keys allows us to create hierarchical deterministic (HD) watching-only wallets. With this kind of wallet, we are able to obtain all the same addresses that we could obtain in our main wallet, related to our mnemonic seed. It could also be very useful if we want to be able to receive transactions on many different public addresses, obtaining them without the need to access our cold storage and keep our private keys safe.</p>
<p>To obtain our master public key, we only have to go to the Wallet menu and click on Information.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/Selection_089.png" alt="" width="350" height="313" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_089-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_089-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_089-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_089-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_089-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_089-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>In the next window we will see a lot of information about our wallet, like our Master Public Key.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/Selection_090.png" alt="" width="800" height="515" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_090-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_090-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_090-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_090-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_090-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_090-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Let's take note of it and let's create a new Standard wallet.</p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight  msg--info">OPSEC TIP: It could be a good idea to access our wallet only in Anu₿itux live and offline, extract our Master Public Key and use it to create our watching-only wallet in a separate working environment that we will connect to the Internet.</p>
<p>In the second step of the creation wizard, we have to choose the "Use a Master Key" option.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/Selection_091.png" alt="" width="600" height="428" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_091-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_091-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_091-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_091-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_091-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_091-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Now we only have to type or paste the Master Public Key and we have set up our watch-only wallet. </p>

<p>As we can see in the following screenshot, we obtained the same addresses in both wallets, with the difference that only one of them would be able to spend the funds we could receive.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/Selection_093.png" alt="" width="1000" height="379" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_093-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_093-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_093-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_093-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_093-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_093-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<h4>Master Public Key</h4>
<p>Let's now hypothesize we want to create a watch-only wallet related to a BIP39 seed. To obtain the Master Public Key we could import our BIP39 seed creating a new Electrum wallet, taking care to specify the right derivation path, and obtain it with the same steps we have seen above, or we could use the <a href="https://github.com/iancoleman/bip39" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ian Coleman BIP39 tool</a>.</p>
<p>Typing the seed in the proper box and selecting the desired derivation path, we will obtain the addresses and the private keys that could be derived from that seed and also many master keys. We are interested in the one named "Account Extended Public Key".</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/Selection_094.png" alt="" width="1000" height="655" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_094-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_094-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_094-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_094-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_094-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_094-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Do not use the "BIP32 Extended Public Key" since it will show different addresses and sending transactions to them could give us some trouble accessing our funds (do not worry, it can be done with the "BIP32 Extended Private Key").</p>
<p>To confirm that the Master Public Key we have chosen is the right one, we can compare the obtained addresses.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/Selection_095.png" alt="" width="800" height="447" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_095-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_095-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_095-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_095-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_095-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_095-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<h3>Monero view-only wallet</h3>
<p>As stated in <a href="https://anubitux.org/how-to-spend-a-monero-paper-wallet-with-anubitux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">other posts</a>, Monero works with two kinds of private keys, a private spend key to sign transactions and a private view key to view information about our addresses since with Monero we can't check information about public addresses as we are used to do with Bitcoin and other cryptos. The private view key is the one we are going to use to set up our watch-only wallets.</p>
<p>For the following examples we are going to use a Monero Paper Wallet generated with our tool <a href="https://anubitux.org/how-to-generate-random-paper-wallets-with-anubitux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dicetracker</a>.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/Selection_106.png" alt="" width="550" height="628" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_106-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_106-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_106-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_106-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_106-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_106-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<h4>Feather wallet</h4>
<p>To set up a watch-only wallet with <a href="https://featherwallet.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Feather Wallet</a>, we have to start the wallet creation wizard and select the "Restore wallet from keys" option.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/Selection_096.png" alt="" width="575" height="576" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_096-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_096-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_096-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_096-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_096-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_096-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>In the next step we have to provide the Primary address and the Secret view Key. The tool itself gives us the tip to not insert the Secret spend key if we are creating a view-only wallet.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/Selection_097.png" alt="" width="575" height="581" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_097-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_097-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_097-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_097-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_097-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_097-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Now we only have to provide the wallet creation date and a password and our watch-only wallet is ready. If we are not sure about the wallet creation date, we can provide a date we are sure is earlier than it, unless so the wallet could not scan some blocks including transactions that we could be interested in.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/Selection_098.png" alt="" width="1000" height="532" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_098-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_098-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_098-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_098-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_098-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_098-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<h4>Monero CLI</h4>
<p>To create a view-only wallet using the <a href="https://www.getmonero.org/downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monero official</a> command line interface wallet, we have to start it with the <em>--generate-from-view-key</em> option followed by the name we are giving to our watch-only wallet. In Anu₿itux you can type:</p>
<p><code>Tools/AddressGen/monero-x86_64-linux-gnu-v0.18.1.2/monero-wallet-cli --generate-from-view-key wallet_name</code></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/Selection_099.png" alt="" width="900" height="204" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_099-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_099-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_099-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_099-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_099-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_099-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>With commands like <em>balance</em> and <em>wallet_info</em> we can obtain some information about our wallet.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/Selection_100.png" alt="" width="700" height="416" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_100-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_100-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_100-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_100-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_100-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_100-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>And with commands like <em>address all</em> and <em>address new</em> we will obtain addresses we could share to request transactions.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/Selection_101.png" alt="" width="800" height="76" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_101-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_101-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_101-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_101-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_101-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_101-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<h3>Ethereum view-only wallet</h3>
<p>To obtain a view-only wallet with Ethereum we could use <a href="https://mycrypto.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MyCrypto</a>, which can be started from the Anu₿itux Wallets menu, and a public address we obtained previously with any desired method.</p>
<p>To obtain our view-only wallet, we only have to start MyCrypto, click on the "View &amp; Send" button on the left of the screen and then click on the </p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/Selection_102.png" alt="" width="1000" height="528" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_102-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_102-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_102-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_102-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_102-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_102-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Now we only have to type or paste our address and our view-only wallet is ready to be used.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/Selection_104.png" alt="" width="500" height="301" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_104-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_104-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_104-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_104-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_104-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_104-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>In this way we can easily monitor our Ethereum account, even for token transactions, without exposing our private keys or our mnemonic seeds.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/Selection_105.png" alt="" width="900" height="704" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_105-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_105-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_105-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_105-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_105-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_105-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<h3>Final thoughts</h3>
<p>Using view-only wallets allows us to manage and monitor our addresses without exposing our private keys unless we need to dispose transactions. It is a very useful feature of many software wallets that we should consider if we are not doing transactions on a regular basis. We only have to remember that obtaining master public keys implies that we are handling our private keys or our seed and this operation has to be done very carefully, to avoid any risk concerning the safety of our funds.</p>

                <p class="msg msg--warning">The ideas presented in this post and in other similar posts on this website have to be considered only like suggestions. Users should adopt the strategies that better fit their threat model and their needs.</p>
<p>Hiding a mnemonic seed is something about everyone has his theories but no one is able to provide the correct solution. We believe that there is no universal solution, but only a lot of different solutions that fit the needs of one user or another.</p>
<p>A good strategy could be to hide our mnemonic seed with steganography. For those who do not know what it is, steganography is the practice of representing a piece of information within another object in a way that could not be easily seen by others. So we could try to hide our mnemonic seed in another file, like a picture or a video. Let's see how we could do it with Anu₿itux.</p>
<h3>The procedure</h3>
<p class="msg msg--highlight "><strong>To safeguard the security of this process, we kindly suggest following all these steps using Anu₿itux live without connecting it to the internet and disabling all the network interfaces with the proper desktop shortcut.</strong></p>
<p>First of all, we need a mnemonic seed to hide. We could obtain it with dice rolls using our tool <a href="https://anubitux.org/how-to-generate-a-mnemonic-seed-with-anubitux-and-a-dice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dice2Seed</a>, or we could obtain it with <a href="https://anubitux.org/how-to-generate-24-words-mnemonic-seeds-with-electrum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Electrum</a> wallet, or with any other tool we think is the best for our needs.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/Selection_075.png" alt="mnemonic" width="900" height="526" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_075-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_075-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_075-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_075-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_075-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_075-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Now we can store it in a text file, since we are assuming we are working in a live and offline environment, in most cases this should imply no risks. We can use this command to easily do that</p>
<p class="align-center"><code>echo 'your words here' &gt; Documents/mnemonic</code></p>
<p>Now we can choose a file to hide our mnemonic seed in. In this case, we are using a copy of the Anu₿itux wallpaper. </p>
<p class="msg msg--warning">It is recommended to do this procedure on a copy of your files, to avoid corrupting or losing them if something goes wrong during the process.</p>
<p>To hide our mnemonic, we are going to use ZuluCrypt. We can find its GUI in the Anu₿itux encryption menu. The required feature, "Encrypted Container Hidden In Video/Cover File (Steganography)" can be found in the "Create" menu. </p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/Selection_076.png" alt="zuluc" width="800" height="461" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_076-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_076-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_076-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_076-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_076-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_076-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Clicking on it we have to provide the file we want to use to hide our information, a password to unlock it and the desired size.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/Selection_077.png" alt="zulus" width="650" height="377" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_077-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_077-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_077-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_077-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_077-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_077-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>In this case, a size of 1 MB will be enough: if we are going to associate a big container with our picture, it would have a very big size that could look suspicious and attract undesired attention.</p>
<p>We also absolutely need to take care of the "Volume Offset" value, because we will need it every time we are going to unlock the container. It is calculated by the tool and indicates where it should look for the container to unlock.</p>
<p>Now we only have to click the "Create" button and our secret container is ready to be mounted. Before doing that, let's take a look at the size of the file we used to hide the container in.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/Selection_078.png" alt="filesize" width="550" height="166" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_078-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_078-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_078-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_078-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_078-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_078-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>As we can see, the file we used for the procedure, even if it looks identical to the original one, has a bigger size of about 1.4 MB.</p>
<p>Now, let's access our container to store the mnemonic seed into it. We can do this with ZuluCrypt, using the "Volume Hosted In A File" feature under the "Open" menu. </p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/Selection_079.png" alt="zuluopen" width="750" height="433" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_079-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_079-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_079-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_079-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_079-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_079-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Now we have to:</p>
<ul>
<li>provide the file we used to hide the container;</li>
<li>select "PLAIN dm-crypt" as "Volume Type";</li>
<li>type the Offset value provided by the tool during the creation of the container;</li>
<li>type the password we chose during the creation process;</li>
<li>click on the "Open" button.</li>
</ul>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/Selection_080.png" alt="zuluprovide" width="600" height="317" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_080-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_080-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_080-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_080-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_080-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_080-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>At this point, we can access the container with our file explorer.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/Selection_081.png" alt="zuludolphin" width="750" height="571" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_081-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_081-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_081-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_081-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_081-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_081-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>We are nor ready to copy our mnemonic seed to the container. Since we are working in a live environment, we do not need to delete it.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/Selection_082.png" alt="mnemonic in container" width="750" height="430" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_082-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_082-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_082-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_082-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_082-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_082-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>At this point we can unmount our volume, by right-clicking on it in the ZuluCrypt GUI and selecting the "Unmount" option.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/Selection_083.png" alt="zuluunmount" width="750" height="436" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_083-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_083-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_083-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_083-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_083-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/44/responsive/Selection_083-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<h3>How to store our container</h3>
<p>We do not have to forget that we are working in a live environment and, if we shut down the system, our cointainer will be irremediably lost. So, before shutting down our system, we should save it somewhere. We could put it on an encrypted drive or into another encrypted container we have previously created using <a href="https://anubitux.org/create-encrypted-volumes-with-veracrypt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VeraCrypt</a> or some other <a href="https://anubitux.org/anubitux-and-encrypted-storages/">similar solution</a>.</p>
<p>Now, when we are sure our hidden container is in a safe place, we can shut down our system without connecting it to the Internet and also restarting it if we need to perform other operations.</p>
<h3>Final thoughts</h3>
<p>There could be infinite other solutions to safely store our mnemonic seed. This has not to be considered the best way to do this but only a suggestion on how to do that in a creative and secure way.</p>
<p>We also need to remember that more is the security we add to our information, the more it could be difficult for us to recover it if we lose or forget the right credentials.</p>
<p>It is also recommended to have more copies of the file hiding the container since the device we are storing it on could get broken or lost at any time and for many different unpredictable reasons.</p>
