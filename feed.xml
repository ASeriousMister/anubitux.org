                <p>Hardware wallets are designed to improve the operational security of crypto users and avoid the loss of their funds. Using such devices in a live system like Anu₿itux, leaving no trace on our main device, could also improve our privacy. Also, if we need to connect an hardware wallet that is not ours, using it in a live enviroment could be useful to prevent the leak of any information.</p>
<h3>How to use hardware wallets</h3>
<p>In Anu₿itux we can find the official clients for Ledger, Trezor, BitBox and BC Vault hardware wallets.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/21/menuw2.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/21/responsive/menuw2-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/21/responsive/menuw2-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/21/responsive/menuw2-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/21/responsive/menuw2-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/21/responsive/menuw2-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/21/responsive/menuw2-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="menuhw" width="450" height="295"></figure>
<p>To use them, simply click on their icons and follow the instructions provided.</p>
<p>Instructions may change according to the used devices and their firmware version. Sometimes, with Ledger Live, it could be necessary to run this script, or our device will encounter connection issues:</p>
<p><code>wget -q -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LedgerHQ/udev-rules/master/add_udev_rules.sh | sudo bash</code></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"> <img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/21/ledgerlive-2.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/21/responsive/ledgerlive-2-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/21/responsive/ledgerlive-2-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/21/responsive/ledgerlive-2-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/21/responsive/ledgerlive-2-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/21/responsive/ledgerlive-2-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/21/responsive/ledgerlive-2-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="ledgerlive" width="800" height="622"></figure>
<p>Using official clients can be useful to manage all the different coins supported by our device.</p>
<p>If we need to connect other kind of hardware wallets or if we are only interested in handling Bitcoin, Litecoin or Bitcoin Cash, we can connect our device through Electrum and its derivations. </p>
<p>Support for the following <a href="https://electrum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hardware-linux.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hardware wallets</a> has been set up:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trezor</li>
<li>Ledger</li>
<li>KeepKey</li>
<li>BitBox</li>
<li>Archos Safe-T</li>
<li>ColdCard</li>
</ul>
<p>To connect them we only have to connect our device and start the desired version of Electrum, choose the "Auto connect" option (or "select server manually" if we know what we are doing), choose a name for our wallet, then select "Standard wallet" and "Use a hardware device". Now Electrum should automatically detect our device.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/21/Electrum-Install-Wizard_001.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/21/responsive/Electrum-Install-Wizard_001-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/21/responsive/Electrum-Install-Wizard_001-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/21/responsive/Electrum-Install-Wizard_001-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/21/responsive/Electrum-Install-Wizard_001-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/21/responsive/Electrum-Install-Wizard_001-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/21/responsive/Electrum-Install-Wizard_001-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="electrumTrezor" width="600" height="429"></figure>
<h3>Final thoughts</h3>
<p>Anu₿itux provides us the possibility to manage hardware wallets in a live ready to use operating system, without the need to download, install and configure appropriate tools each time we need it. Of course, using this kind of solution we need to pay even more attention to how we backup our mnemonic seed, because rebooting Anu₿itux will completely delete our current working session. </p>

                <p>Online we can read about lots of posts and messages from people that lost access to their Bitcoin wallet, maybe because they did not pay enough attention to it or maybe because they stored keys on old hard drives full of stuff many years ago, believing Bitcoin was not going to became that big. With Anu₿itux we can try to solve this matter, scanning directories and volumes automatically with the tool <a href="https://github.com/ASeriousMister/BTCKeySearch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BTCKeySearch</a>, developed by the Anu₿itux team.</p>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>BTCKeySearch is a very simple and powerful Python tool. It can be found in the "Recovery" section of the Anu₿itux menu or it can be run directly in the command line, with the "-d" option followed by the path we in which we want to look for private keys.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/24/btcks1.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/24/responsive/btcks1-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/24/responsive/btcks1-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/24/responsive/btcks1-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/24/responsive/btcks1-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/24/responsive/btcks1-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/24/responsive/btcks1-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="btcks1" width="650" height="517"></figure>
<p>Now the tool maps all the files that are stored in the given directory, including all the subdirectories, and starts reading the contained text, looking for strings that could match Bitcoin private keys.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/24/btcks2.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/24/responsive/btcks2-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/24/responsive/btcks2-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/24/responsive/btcks2-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/24/responsive/btcks2-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/24/responsive/btcks2-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/24/responsive/btcks2-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="btcks2" width="650" height="534"></figure>
<p>If we open the files scanned by BTCKeySearch, we can see that it did its job. Infact, all the Bitcoin private keys placed among the text were found.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/24/btcks3.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/24/responsive/btcks3-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/24/responsive/btcks3-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/24/responsive/btcks3-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/24/responsive/btcks3-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/24/responsive/btcks3-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/24/responsive/btcks3-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="btcks3" width="1200" height="791"></figure>
<h3>Final thoughts</h3>
<p>This tool was specifically realized to find Bitcoin private keys in a quick way, but AnuBitux also includes <a href="http://cdn-fastly.deb.debian.org/debian/pool/main/s/searchmonkey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SearchMonkey</a> and <a href="https://github.com/simsong/bulk_extractor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BulkExtractor</a> that could be used for the similar purposes by advanced users, configuring them with the appropriate regular expressions.</p>
<h3>Updates</h3>
<p>BTCKeySearch is now able to find Monero private spend keys and and BIP32 root keys (xpriv). Output is also more readable. </p>

            <summary>
                <![CDATA[
                        <img src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/flower-g3055cbc13_1920.jpg" alt="Flower" />

            <![CDATA[
                    <img src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/flower-g3055cbc13_1920.jpg" alt="Flower" />
                <p>There could be many situations in which we need to check how a seed was used: for example we could have a lot of old seeds and did not take note about how they were used, or we could be a consultant helping others recovering access to their funds. It can become very frustrating and time consuming checking the seeds with many different tools, to find out the right one.</p>
<p>In this case,  Anu₿itux could help us with <a href="https://github.com/ASeriousMister/SeedCheck.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seedcheck.py</a>, a tool developed by its team.</p>
<h3>How to use it</h3>
<p>To run seedcheck.py, simply type it in Anu₿itux's terminal.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/sc1.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc1-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc1-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc1-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc1-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc1-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc1-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="sc1" width="650" height="516"></figure>
<p>Then the only thing we have to do is answer the prompted questions. First of all, the tool asks us if we want to check online if the addresses derived with the seed we are looking about had some activity. This information is used to determinate with what currency the seed was used and which one could be the correct <a href="https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/derivation-paths" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">derivation path</a>. </p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/sc2.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc2-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc2-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc2-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc2-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc2-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc2-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="sc2" width="650" height="523"></figure>
<p>If we are worried about our privacy, we can ask no to this question and the tool will work completely offline. We could also start the <a href="https://github.com/moonchitta/anonsurf-ubuntu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anonymous proxy</a>, clicking on the provided desktop shortcut and all our network traffic will be routed through TOR.</p>
<p>Then we have to provide the seed's lenght, without counting an eventual passphrase as part of it. Don't worry, the tool will ask later for it. Now, we can insert the words composing our seed.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/sc3.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc3-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc3-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc3-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc3-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc3-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc3-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="sc3" width="650" height="519"></figure>
<p>We can now provide a passphrase, if the seed has one. Then we can specify the language of the seed, to check it with the correct wordlists.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/sc4.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc4-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc4-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc4-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc4-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc4-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc4-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="sc4" width="650" height="516"></figure>
<p>If we are not sure about it, we can simply answer "all" and the tool will determinate the language itself.</p>
<p>The accepted answers are:</p>
<ul>
<li>english</li>
<li>italian</li>
<li>french</li>
<li>spanish</li>
<li>portuguese</li>
<li>czech</li>
<li>chinese_simplified</li>
<li>chinese_traditional</li>
<li>japanese</li>
<li>korean</li>
<li>russian</li>
<li>esperanto</li>
<li>lojban</li>
</ul>
<p>Please, provide the languages as they are written in the above list, or the tool could encounter running issues.</p>
<p>Now, we can ask how many addresses we want to derive for any supported derivation path. It impacts on the ouput of the tool and on the amount of the check that the tool will do online.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/sc5.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc5-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc5-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc5-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc5-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc5-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc5-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="sc5" width="650" height="519"></figure>
<p>More addresses we derive, more are the possibilities to find used ones. The tool will suggest us a maximum of 15 addresses, to avoid to overload the APIs queried during the check, but if we need we can force it to derive as many addresses we want.</p>
<p>Now the tool start its magic, checking if the seed was used with an <a href="https://electrum.org/#home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Electrum</a> wallet, or if it is a <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/tree/master/bip-0039" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BIP39</a> seed used with many different derivation paths to derive Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Dash or ZCash addresses. It is also going to check if the seed was used with <a href="https://samouraiwallet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samourai</a>'s Whirlpool, deriving premix and postmix addresses. The tool also checks if the provided seed is compatible with Monero wallets (like <a href="https://mymonero.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MyMonero</a>, <a href="https://featherwallet.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Feather wallet</a> or <a href="https://www.getmonero.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monero wallet</a>).</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/sc6.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc6-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc6-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc6-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc6-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc6-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc6-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="sc6" width="650" height="513"></figure>
<p>As we can see, the tool was able to determinate that the tool was used with Electrum, because the addresses derived with Electrum's algorithms had some activity.</p>
<p>The tool also find out that the seed could have been derived from a BIP39 wordlist, and checks it with many different coins.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/sc7.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc7-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc7-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc7-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc7-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc7-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc7-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="sc7" width="650" height="513"></figure>
<p>But, in this case, the tool did not find any valid derivation path because no one of the derived addesses was involved in any transaction.</p>
<p>The tool also works with Monero seeds. Let's check how it works in this case.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/sc9.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc9-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc9-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc9-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc9-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc9-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc9-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="sc8" width="650" height="522"></figure>
<p>As we can see, the tool was able to find out that the tool is compatible with Feather wallet. To check if it had some activity, simply open Feather wallet, that is also available in the Anu₿itux wallets menu, and use it to restore a wallet providing this seed.</p>
<h3>Final thoughts</h3>
<p>Of course this tool does not a full check, because the seed could have been used with other coins or with custom derivation paths or with some other proprietary algorithm, but it is a great help to rapidly do a lot of checks. If it gives us a positive result, we can be sure that the seed was used but, if it gives us a negative result, to be completely sure the seed was never used we shoudl try it with as many tools as we can.</p>

            <![CDATA[
                    <img src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/9/security-g77e3e3bd2_1280.jpg" alt="Unlock" />
                <p>It is a weird thing but it may happen that we forget our wallet's password. Of course, we could use our mnemonic seed to recover it, but there could also be other cases in which we could be looking for a wallet's password. Let's see how we could recover access to the wallet with Anu₿itux, using <a href="https://btcrecover.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">btcrecover</a>.</p>
<h3>What is btcrecover?</h3>
<p>In Anu₿itux, we can find btcrecover in the Anu₿itux menu, under the "Recovery" section. This will show only a hint about how to use it, because it has no user interface and needs to be run in our command line. It is a very powerful python tool that gives us a lot of different solutions to recover access to our wallets. It works with wallet files of many different clients (like Electrum, BitcoinCore, Coinomi, MetaMask, etc.), encrypted private keys, bip39 seeds with passphrase, and more. <a href="https://btcrecover.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Usage_Examples/basic_password_recoveries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here</a> you can find the official documentation about its password recovery features.  </p>
<h3>How to use it with Anu₿itux</h3>
<p>Let's assume we have a wallet file we do not remember the password. First of all we need to prepare a list of passwords we want to try. We can do it writing a list of possibile passwords, using a prepared <a href="https://www.hacktoday.com/password-cracking-dictionarys-download-for-free/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dictionary</a>, exporting passwords from other available sources like mobiles, browsers, password managers, etc.</p>
<p>For our purpose we are using a small custom list, just to test how the tool works and a prepared Electrum wallet file. Electrum wallet files can usually be found in the /home/anubitux/.electrum/wallets directory. Notice that with Linux operating systems folders and files which name starts with "." are hidden and may not be shown if the specific option is disabled.</p>
<p>It can be useful to place a copy of the wallet file we are trying to unlock in a separate folder, to avoid any accidental malfuntion and risk to corrupt the original copy of the file. In our case it is placed in the Documents foler.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/9/btcrec1.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/9/responsive/btcrec1-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/9/responsive/btcrec1-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/9/responsive/btcrec1-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/9/responsive/btcrec1-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/9/responsive/btcrec1-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/9/responsive/btcrec1-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="btcrec1" width="800" height="511"></figure>
<p>Now let's try to unlock the wallet file running btcrecover. We have to use the --wallet option to indicate the path to the wallet file and --passwordlist to indicate the text file containing the passwords we want to try.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/9/btcr2.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/9/responsive/btcr2-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/9/responsive/btcr2-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/9/responsive/btcr2-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/9/responsive/btcr2-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/9/responsive/btcr2-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/9/responsive/btcr2-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="btcr2" width="800" height="520"></figure>
<p class="msg msg--success">We could also use shorter paths to file, like "<em>Documents/wallet_to_recover</em>". So the command would be: <em>btcrecover.py --wallet Documents/wallet_to_recover --passwordlist Documents/list</em>. We could also move to the directory containing the files we need, using che <em>cd</em> command, and run the tool from there.</p>
<p>Now clicking Enter, the tool is going to load the password list and to identify the kind of wallet file. Then it will start trying all the words until it finds the right one.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/9/btcr3.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/9/responsive/btcr3-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/9/responsive/btcr3-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/9/responsive/btcr3-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/9/responsive/btcr3-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/9/responsive/btcr3-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/9/responsive/btcr3-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="btcr3" width="800" height="510"></figure>
<p>As we can see in the picture, the tool has found the correct password in a few seconds, even because in this case we were trying only a list of eight words and the fifth was the correct one.</p>
<h3>Some advice</h3>
<p>As it is possible to see in the output of the tool, in a first stage it loads the whole file containing the password list. If we are attempting to bruteforce a wallet with a big dictionary, it could saturate the RAM memory causing running issues in the whole running system. To avoid this kind of issue, it could be a good idea to split the text file in multiple smaller files. We can do that with the split command, like in the following examples:</p>
<p><code>split -l 10000 whole_list partial_list</code></p>
<p>This will create a set of files, which name starts with "partial_list", each one containing 10000 lines.</p>
<p><code>split -b 100M whole_list partial_list</code></p>
<p>This will create a set of files, which name starts with "partial_list", each one with a size of 100 MB.</p>

                <p>Knowing the public address on our <a href="https://anubitux.org/how-to-create-a-paper-wallet-with-anubitux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">paper wallet</a>, we will be able to receive funds and monitor our balance in many different ways, like with a watch-only wallet created with Electrum or using public block explorers.</p>
<p>If we want to spend our funds, we need to know the private key that is reported on the paper wallet and that should have been kept secret until now. But how could we use this private key? Anu₿itux provides us all we need to do it in a safe way.</p>
<h3>The steps to follow</h3>
<p>One of the best softwares to use in this case is, for sure, <a href="https://electrum.org/#home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Electrum</a>. First of all launch it going in the Anu₿itux menu, under the "Wallets" section.</p>
<p>In the first screen select "Auto connect" or "Select server manually" if you know what you are doing.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/18/elec1.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/18/responsive/elec1-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/18/responsive/elec1-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/18/responsive/elec1-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/18/responsive/elec1-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/18/responsive/elec1-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/18/responsive/elec1-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="Elec1" width="600" height="444"></figure>
<p class="msg msg--success"><em>If you are concerned about privacy or IP address leakage, you can use <a href="https://github.com/moonchitta/anonsurf-ubuntu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AnonSurf</a> clicking on the dedicated desktop icon lebeled "Start Anonymous Proxy".</em></p>
<p>Then, in the next window, let's choose a name for our wallet.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/18/elec2.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/18/responsive/elec2-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/18/responsive/elec2-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/18/responsive/elec2-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/18/responsive/elec2-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/18/responsive/elec2-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/18/responsive/elec2-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="elec2" width="600" height="442"></figure>
<p>Let's select the last option, "Import Bitcoin addresses or private keys".</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/18/elec3-2.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/18/responsive/elec3-2-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/18/responsive/elec3-2-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/18/responsive/elec3-2-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/18/responsive/elec3-2-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/18/responsive/elec3-2-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/18/responsive/elec3-2-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="elec3" width="600" height="448"></figure>
<p>We can now import our private key in many different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>writing it manually (only if you have time and patience);</li>
<li>clicking on the camera icon on the right bottom our webcam will be started and we can grab the private key's QR code from our paper wallet;</li>
<li>clicking on the folder icon near the camera icon we could import it from a text file (it is very unsafe to store private keys in text files unless using encrypted storages);</li>
<li>copying and pasting it from some source (also in this case, it is very important to keep private keys in safe places like <a href="https://keepassxc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kdbx databases</a>, encrypted volumes, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/18/elec4.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/18/responsive/elec4-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/18/responsive/elec4-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/18/responsive/elec4-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/18/responsive/elec4-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/18/responsive/elec4-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/18/responsive/elec4-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="elec4" width="600" height="442"></figure>
<p>It is very important to specify the right format of your private key, according to the address format we want to get:</p>
<ul>
<li>p2pkh address (those starting with 1);</li>
<li>p2wpkh address (those starting with bc1);</li>
<li>p2wpkh-p2sh address (those starting with 3).</li>
</ul>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/18/elec5-2.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/18/responsive/elec5-2-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/18/responsive/elec5-2-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/18/responsive/elec5-2-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/18/responsive/elec5-2-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/18/responsive/elec5-2-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/18/responsive/elec5-2-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="elec5" width="600" height="435"></figure>
<p>In this case we are importing the same private key using three different formats, and we are expecting to obtain three different addresses in three different formats. This is because every specified format corresponds to a different derivation path.</p>
<p>As last step, set-up a password for your wallet.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/18/elec6.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/18/responsive/elec6-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/18/responsive/elec6-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/18/responsive/elec6-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/18/responsive/elec6-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/18/responsive/elec6-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/18/responsive/elec6-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="elec6" width="600" height="441"></figure>
<p>Now we have obtained our addresses.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/18/elec7.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/18/responsive/elec7-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/18/responsive/elec7-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/18/responsive/elec7-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/18/responsive/elec7-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/18/responsive/elec7-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/18/responsive/elec7-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="elec7" width="850" height="450"></figure>
<p>As expected, we obtained three addresses, one starting with 1, one starting with 3 and a third starting with bc1. Specifing the wrong format for the key we are importing could give us the feel that the address has no funds available. So, when we store private keys, it is a good idea to keep note also of the correct format to use when spending funds will be necessary. </p>
<h3>Final thoughts</h3>
<p>A paper wallet is a cold storage solution to store coins in a safe way if it is managed properly. When importing it, all its security features disappear. So it is adviced to spend all the available funds sending the change amount to a new safe <a href="https://anubitux.org/how-to-create-a-paper-wallet-with-anubitux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">paper wallet</a>.</p>
<p>To do so, go to "Tools" -&gt; "Pay to many" and specify the address (or the addresses) you want to send funds and the address of your new secure paper wallet. All the addresses have to be followed by the amount you want to send to each one (separated by a comma), like in the following picture.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/18/elec8-2.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/18/responsive/elec8-2-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/18/responsive/elec8-2-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/18/responsive/elec8-2-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/18/responsive/elec8-2-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/18/responsive/elec8-2-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/18/responsive/elec8-2-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="elec8" width="850" height="455"></figure>
<p>In this way, we can spend the funds we have to pay to someone and directly send the change to a new secure paper wallet, without the need to dispose many transactions, saving up time and fees.</p>

                    <img src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/20/verified-gcc6c27d92_1920.png" alt="Verified" />
                <p>When you have downloaded your favoured Anu₿itux version from the official <a href="https://anubitux.org/download-anubitux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">download page</a>, it could be a good idea to verify if the file you've obtained is not corrupted or has not been altered by some malicious threat actor.</p>
<p>First of all notice that on the dowload page, at the bottom, there is a list of hash values for each downloadable version of Anu₿itux.</p>
<h3><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/20/pgp1.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/20/responsive/pgp1-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/20/responsive/pgp1-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/20/responsive/pgp1-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/20/responsive/pgp1-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/20/responsive/pgp1-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/20/responsive/pgp1-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="pgp1" width="569" height="809"></figure>What's a hash value?</h3>
<p>A hash value is like a fingerprint of a file. It is obtained processing the content of a file through a specific cryptographic algorithm. This will return a string of fixed lenght, the hash value:</p>
<ul>
<li>it will be the same every time it is calculated on files with the same content;</li>
<li>it is not reversible;</li>
<li>changing only a single detail of the content of the examined file will give a completely different hash value.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to calculate the hash value</h3>
<p>There are different methods to calculate hash values, also depending on the operating system you are using.</p>
<h4>Linux</h4>
<p>Under Linux, to calculate the hash values, simply use your terminal, change the working directory with the one where the file you want to calculate the hash value is stored with, for example</p>
<p><code>cd Downloads</code></p>
<p>then simply use</p>
<p><code>md5sum Anubitux_2022_1_live.iso</code></p>
<p><code>sha1sum Anubitux_2022_1_live.iso</code></p>
<p>The commands will print the hash values in your command line. Compare them with the ones shown in the Anu₿itux download page to be sure you have downloaded the correct file.</p>
<h4>Windows</h4>
<p>Under Windows, the best way to check hash values is using some tools like <a href="https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/hash_my_files.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HashMyFiles</a>, <a href="https://www.quickhash-gui.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">QuickHash</a>, <a href="https://gtkhash.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GTKhash</a>, <a href="https://github.com/namazso/OpenHashTab" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenHashTab</a> or <a href="https://www.binaryfortress.com/HashTools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HashTools</a>.</p>
<p>These are all very simple to use GUI tools.</p>
<p>When done, always compare the obtained hash values with the ones shown in the Anu₿itux download page to be sure you have downloaded the correct file.</p>
<h4>MacOS</h4>
<p>Under MacOS, to calculate the hash values, simply use your terminal, change the working directory with the one where the file you want to calculate the hash value is stored with, for example</p>
<p><code>cd Downloads</code></p>
<p>then simply use</p>
<p><code>md5 Anubitux_2022_1_live.iso</code></p>
<p><code>sha1 Anubitux_2022_1_live.iso</code></p>
<p>The commands will print the hash values in your command line. Compare them with the ones shown in the Anu₿itux download page to be sure you have downloaded the correct file.</p>
<h3>How to be sure about hash values?</h3>
<p>Hash values shown on the Anu₿itux <a href="https://anubitux.org/download-anubitux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">download page</a> have been signed with PGP. To be sure that the displayed hash values are correct, you can check the PGP signature. To do so, first of all download our PGP key from the proposed sources: <a href="https://github.com/ASeriousMister/Anubitux-PGP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">github</a> or <a href="https://pastebin.com/bqmy9y2P" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pastebin</a>.</p>
<p>Then import it in a PGP client like <a href="https://www.openpgp.org/software/kleopatra/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kleopatra</a>. To do that simply drag and drop the .asc file into its interface or copy the key content in your clipboard and, in Kleopatra, go to "Tools" -&gt; "Clipboard" -&gt; "Certificate import".</p>
<p>You may need to certify the key to use it properly. To do so right click on it and select "Certify".</p>
<p>Then open  the Kleopatra's notepad, like in the following picture:</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/20/Kleopatra_001.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/20/responsive/Kleopatra_001-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/20/responsive/Kleopatra_001-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/20/responsive/Kleopatra_001-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/20/responsive/Kleopatra_001-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/20/responsive/Kleopatra_001-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/20/responsive/Kleopatra_001-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="pgp2" width="800" height="480"></figure>
<p>Now copy and paste the part of the Anu₿itux <a href="https://anubitux.org/download-anubitux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">download page</a> containing the hash values and the PGP signature.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/20/Kleopatra_002.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/20/responsive/Kleopatra_002-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/20/responsive/Kleopatra_002-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/20/responsive/Kleopatra_002-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/20/responsive/Kleopatra_002-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/20/responsive/Kleopatra_002-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/20/responsive/Kleopatra_002-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="pgp2" width="800" height="480"></figure>
<p>Now click on "Decrypt / Verify Notepad" and, if everithing is okay, you shoul see a message similar to the following one.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/20/Kleopatra_003.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/20/responsive/Kleopatra_003-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/20/responsive/Kleopatra_003-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/20/responsive/Kleopatra_003-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/20/responsive/Kleopatra_003-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/20/responsive/Kleopatra_003-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/20/responsive/Kleopatra_003-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="pgp4" width="800" height="480"></figure>
<p>Following these steps you will be sure that the downloaded file corresponds to the original version of Anu₿itux, because its hash value corresponds to the one shown on the download page and the message on the download page has not been altered because it has a valid PGP signature.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.getmonero.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monero</a> is very well known as the primary privacy coin because, unlike other coins, it does not disclose information about addresses and transactions even if it has a decentralized protocol. If you are interestend in Monero, consider reading <a href="https://masteringmonero.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mastering Monero</a>, written by <a href="https://serhack.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SerHack</a>. </p>
<h3>The steps to follow</h3>
<p>Who handles Monero usually cares a lot about his privacy, so, creating a wallet in a secure way, becomes a fundamental matter.</p>
<p>Let's see the steps to follow to create a secure Monero paper wallet. This tutorial only takes care about the creation process. The safe storage of the paper wallet completely lies on the user. </p>
<h4>Test the enviroment</h4>
<p>As for <a href="https://anubitux.org/how-to-create-a-paper-wallet-with-anubitux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bitcoin paper wallets</a>,  we need to test if the enviroment has all we will need during the process. First of all it could be appropriate to test if the printer works. <span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Anu₿itux comes with a lot of printer drivers. </span>To check if your printer is supported, simply start <span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Anu₿itux live, plug it in and turn it on.</span></p>
<p class="msg msg--warning"><em>When creating a paper wallet that is going to store our cryptos, no care is enough. Always prefer printers connected by cable and avoid connection types like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth because the data could be sent unencrypted and some threat actor could sniff it.</em></p>
<p>If the printer is supported by <span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Anu₿itux, you'll see a notification like the one in the below picture.</span></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/6/Selection_001.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/6/responsive/Selection_001-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/6/responsive/Selection_001-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/6/responsive/Selection_001-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/6/responsive/Selection_001-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/6/responsive/Selection_001-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/6/responsive/Selection_001-2xl.png 1600w"  sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/6/responsive/Selection_001-xs.png 300w, https://anubitux.org/media/posts/6/responsive/Selection_001-sm.png 480w, https://anubitux.org/media/posts/6/responsive/Selection_001-md.png 768w, https://anubitux.org/media/posts/6/responsive/Selection_001-lg.png 1024w, https://anubitux.org/media/posts/6/responsive/Selection_001-xl.png 1360w, https://anubitux.org/media/posts/6/responsive/Selection_001-2xl.png 1600w" alt="PrinterOK" width="385" height="158" loading="lazy"></figure>
<p>To be sure it works, you can click on the "Print test page" button.</p>
<p>When we are sure that the printer works and don't have the need of an Internet connection to download additional drivers, let's disable all the communications using the specific desktop shortcut "Go offline" that will disable networking and bluetooth features.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/6/AnuBitux_2022_1_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_001.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/6/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_001-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/6/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_001-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/6/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_001-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/6/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_001-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/6/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_001-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/6/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_001-2xl.png 1600w"  sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/6/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_001-xs.png 300w, https://anubitux.org/media/posts/6/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_001-sm.png 480w, https://anubitux.org/media/posts/6/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_001-md.png 768w, https://anubitux.org/media/posts/6/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_001-lg.png 1024w, https://anubitux.org/media/posts/6/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_001-xl.png 1360w, https://anubitux.org/media/posts/6/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_001-2xl.png 1600w" alt="Offline" width="700" height="431" loading="lazy"></figure>
<h4>Proceed with the generation</h4>
<p>To generate the paper wallet, <span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Anu₿itux has two tools availabe:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.getmonero.org/downloads/#cli" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MoneroCLI</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/moneromooo-monero/monero-wallet-generator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MoneroWalletGenerator</a></li>
</ul>
<h5>MoneroCLI</h5>
<p>MoneroCLI is the official command-line interface Monero wallet. It has to be considered the most secure solution but it could be a bit difficult to use.</p>
<p>Following this steps you will encounter no difficulties:</p>
<ul>
<li>start the tool clicking on it in the <span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Anu₿itux menu;</span></li>
<li>choose a name for the wallet (don't worry about it because <span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Anu₿itux is a live enviroment and every file we are going to create will disappear only rebooting the system);</span></li>
</ul>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/xmr1.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/responsive/xmr1-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/responsive/xmr1-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/responsive/xmr1-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/responsive/xmr1-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/responsive/xmr1-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/responsive/xmr1-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="xmr1" width="741" height="571"></figure>
<ul>
<li>Since we are using a live operating system, the wallet is not going to exist so let's create it answering "yes" to the prompted question and then choose a password (it could also be a simple password because it will be needed only in the current working session and it will be prompted many times during the procedure);</li>
</ul>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/xmr2.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/responsive/xmr2-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/responsive/xmr2-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/responsive/xmr2-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/responsive/xmr2-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/responsive/xmr2-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/responsive/xmr2-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="xmr2" width="689" height="548"> </figure>
<ul>
<li>now let's choose a language that will be used by the Monero wallet to use the corresponding word list and give back a mnemonic seed composed by 25 words. Taking note of this seed could be enough to recover access to the wallet but it is not enough to receive funds since we need to know our receiving address;</li>
</ul>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/xmr3.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/responsive/xmr3-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/responsive/xmr3-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/responsive/xmr3-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/responsive/xmr3-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/responsive/xmr3-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/responsive/xmr3-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="xmr3" width="703" height="744"></figure>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">Let's answer "no" at the question about the daemon since we do not need it. Now our Monero wallet is ready to use;</span><br><br></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Let's obtain the information we need to put on our paper wallet with some simple commands;</li>
</ul>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/xmr5.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/responsive/xmr5-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/responsive/xmr5-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/responsive/xmr5-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/responsive/xmr5-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/responsive/xmr5-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/responsive/xmr5-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="xmr5" width="692" height="747"></figure>
<ul>
<li>The commands are:
<ul>
<li>address (to obtain the first receiving address, with index 0 and starting with 4)</li>
<li>viewkey (to obtain the view keys; password will be prompted);</li>
<li>spendkey (to obtain the spend keys; password will be prompted);</li>
<li>seed (to obtain the mnemonic seed phrase; password will be prompted);</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Now, let's put all the obtained onformation on a text document coping it, opening LibreOffice Writer and pasting it;</li>
</ul>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/xmr6.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/responsive/xmr6-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/responsive/xmr6-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/responsive/xmr6-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/responsive/xmr6-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/responsive/xmr6-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/responsive/xmr6-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="xmr6" width="934" height="843"></figure>
<ul>
<li>This paper wallet could be very inconvenient to use, since we could need to copy it by hand when we need it. So let's create QR codes of the most useful information with <a href="https://github.com/fukuchi/libqrencode/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">QRencode</a>;</li>
<li>QRencode is a simple command line tool. By clicking the menu entry you will se some useful information about how to use it;</li>
<li>With the following commands, we will be able to create all the information we need;</li>
</ul>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/xmr7.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/responsive/xmr7-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/responsive/xmr7-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/responsive/xmr7-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/responsive/xmr7-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/responsive/xmr7-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/responsive/xmr7-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="xmr7" width="680" height="545"></figure>
<p><code>example: qrencode -m 10 -o address.png '4793YRajr7VcopSkF8ZeAvYBZYFf3TRVQAeVoSzNhaz6FMgXDgsVabiWBZDKSuByiVR6522soZLdD3sAcC26N1qUE9GnzmC'</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Now let's put the obtained pictures in our text document and let's arrange the text removing useless parts and formatting the labels;</li>
</ul>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/xmr8.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/responsive/xmr8-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/responsive/xmr8-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/responsive/xmr8-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/responsive/xmr8-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/responsive/xmr8-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/responsive/xmr8-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="xmr8" width="647" height="857"></figure>
<ul>
<li>Here we have our "homemade" paper wallet. Let's print it and we are done!</li>
<li>It could also be useful to print a reduced version of the paper wallet only with the public address and the view keys, to be able to receive funds and monitor our address without taking the risk to compromise the information that give the right to spend funds.</li>
</ul>
<h5>MoneroWalletGenerator</h5>
<p>MoneroWalletGenerator is a ready to use paper wallet generator tool. It is easier and faster than the previous solution. The advantage of using MoneroCLI is that we are using the official client and we are not relying on tools developed by others. Of course, this is an open source tool and no issues were ever reported about it, so it could be considered absolutely reliable as the previous one.</p>
<p>To use MoneroWalletGenerator simply start it by clicking on the menu entry. Firefox browser will be shown with a ready to use paper wallet.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/xmr9-2.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/responsive/xmr9-2-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/responsive/xmr9-2-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/responsive/xmr9-2-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/responsive/xmr9-2-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/responsive/xmr9-2-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/responsive/xmr9-2-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="xmr9" width="1080" height="507"></figure>
<p>All the information are shown only in text in the page, but printing it QR codes will be automatically included.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/xmr10.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/responsive/xmr10-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/responsive/xmr10-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/responsive/xmr10-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/responsive/xmr10-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/responsive/xmr10-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/8/responsive/xmr10-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="xmr10" width="1080" height="594"></figure>
<p>In this case it could be useful to print an extra copy of the first page to have the receiving address available if we need to receive funds, without the need to handle the whole paper wallet.</p>

                <p>Anu₿itux is a linux distro based on <a href="https://kubuntu.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kubuntu</a>. By default, Anu₿itux has the network monitor enabled in the lower panel, but it could not show any data because it needs to be configured accordingly to the network interfaces of the device you are using.</p>
<p>To make it work properly, right click on the right part of the lower panel, near the notification area, as shown below and click on "Configure network monitor".</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/7/AnuBitux_2022_1_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_004-2.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/7/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_004-2-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/7/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_004-2-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/7/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_004-2-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/7/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_004-2-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/7/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_004-2-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/7/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_004-2-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="RightClick" width="1024" height="499"></figure>
<p>Then mark all the available check-boxes, corresponding to the available network interfaces, to show the inbound and outbound network traffic on your panel and always be able to see if something is going on.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/7/AnuBitux_2022_1_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_005-2.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/7/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_005-2-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/7/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_005-2-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/7/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_005-2-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/7/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_005-2-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/7/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_005-2-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/7/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_005-2-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="Interfaces" width="700" height="542"></figure>
<p>Now you will be able to see two coloured waves on the panel that symbolize the network load.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/7/AnuBitux_2022_1_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_006.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/7/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_006-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/7/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_006-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/7/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_006-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/7/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_006-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/7/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_006-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/7/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_006-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="NetworkLoad" width="575" height="170"></figure>
<p>This feature is very userful to notice if a service or a tool is doing some unexpected network traffic.</p>

                    <img src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/6/front-300dpi.jpg" alt="PaperWallet" />
                <p>One of the purposes of who uses a live work enviroment like <span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Anu₿itux is to leave no traces on the device. This feature could be very useful when doing things that need to remain secret, like creating a paper wallet. </span></p>
<p>When we create a paper wallet with our daily operating system, even if we delete the file when the process is complete, some information could remain on our disk, like cached pages and thumbnails, or worse, some information could be sent through the Internet to some remote device that could store our private keys. Consider what happened with <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/02/24/bitcoinpaperwallet-back-door-responsible-for-millions-in-missing-funds-research-suggests/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bitcoinpaperwallet</a>.</p>
<p>Using a live enviroment, the operating system is not stored on the internal hard drive of the device we are using, but only on the RAM memory. So, in the most cases, turning off our device will delete its content because it is considered to be a volatile memory and no one will be able to recover its content.</p>
<h3>The steps to follow</h3>
<p>Let's see the steps to follow to create a secure paper wallet. This tutorial only takes care about the creation process. The safe storage of the paper wallet completely lies on the user. </p>
<h4>Test the enviroment</h4>
<p><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Anu₿itux comes not only with a lot of cool tools. It also has lots of printer drivers installed. Before proceding, it is a good idea to test if our printer is supported by Anu₿itux or if we need to download separate drivers (if so, please let us know which driver is missing so that it can be added in the next release).</span></p>
<p>To do that, simply start <span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Anu₿itux live, plug in your printer and turn it on.</span></p>
<p class="msg msg--warning"><em>When creating a paper wallet that is going to store our cryptos, no care is enough. Always prefer printers connected by cable and avoid connection types like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth because the data could be sent unencrypted and some threat actor could sniff it.</em></p>
<p>If the printer is supported by <span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Anu₿itux, you'll see a notification like the one in the below picture.</span></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/6/Selection_001.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/6/responsive/Selection_001-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/6/responsive/Selection_001-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/6/responsive/Selection_001-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/6/responsive/Selection_001-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/6/responsive/Selection_001-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/6/responsive/Selection_001-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="PrinterOK" width="385" height="158"></figure>
<p>To be sure it works, you can click on the "Print test page" button.</p>
<h4>Proceed with the generation</h4>
<p>Now, to be sure that the enviroment is not communicating with any external device, you can use the button placed on the desktop with the "Go Offline" label. It will turn off networking and bluetooth communication.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/6/AnuBitux_2022_1_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_001.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/6/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_001-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/6/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_001-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/6/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_001-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/6/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_001-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/6/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_001-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/6/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_001-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="Offline" width="700" height="431"></figure>
