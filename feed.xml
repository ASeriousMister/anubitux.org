            <![CDATA[
                    <p><img src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/veracrypt.png" class="type:primaryImage" alt="" /></p>
                <p>When we use Anu₿itux in its main version, the live one, it doesn't store anything about what we are doing. But, of course, we could need to store some useful information, like wallet files, transactions we want to broadcast, passwords, KeePass files, etc. It could be a good idea to store this kind of information on an external storage, like a hard disk or an USB drive. To avoid sharing any information we want to keep private with some third party, we could think to protect it with encryption. To do that, we can use <a href="https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Home.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VeraCrypt</a>. This tool allows us to encrypt entire volumes or create some encrypted containers and works almost with all the main desktop operating systems.</p>
<p>Let's see how to encrypt an external storage and how to create an encrypted container, to store our sensitive information and safely access them while using Anu₿itux.</p>
<h3>Encrypt an external storage</h3>
<p>Now we are going to see how to encrypt an external storage, like an USB drive.</p>
<p class="msg msg--warning">Note that this procedure is going to erase the content of your device, and is not going to add encryption over it. So, before proceeding make sure you are using a new device or an empty one. Unless so, you could lose your files.</p>
<p class="msg msg--warning">Remember that it is always a good idea to back up more copies of what we are storing on our devices since they could stop working at any time. We should always avoid relying on a single point of failure.</p>
<p>First of all, let's start the Veracrypt tool, which can be found in the Encryption menu and click on the "Create Volume" button.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/Selection_063.png" alt="veracrypt_start" width="600" height="683" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_063-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_063-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_063-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_063-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_063-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_063-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>On the upcoming menu, we have to select "Encrypt a non-system partition/drive". Veracrypt could also be used to encrypt system drives, but it decreases sensibly the performance of your disk, so in these cases consider using system disk encryptions like <a href="https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LUKS</a>, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/it-it/windows/security/information-protection/bitlocker/bitlocker-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BitLocker</a> or <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204837" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FileVault</a>.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/Selection_064.png" alt="veracrypt_select" width="800" height="518" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_064-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_064-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_064-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_064-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_064-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_064-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>In the next step, we can choose the "Standard Volume" option. The "Create <a href="https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Hidden%20Volume.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hidden Volume</a>" option is also available. It can be very useful if we have to set up plausible deniability strategies.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/Selection_065.png" alt="veracrypt_standard" width="800" height="514" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_065-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_065-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_065-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_065-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_065-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_065-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Now we have to select the device we want to encrypt.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/Selection_066.png" alt="veracrypt_device" width="800" height="728" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_066-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_066-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_066-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_066-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_066-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_066-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>in the next step, we can choose the encryption algorithm. We can leave the default settings as they are since they work pretty well unless we have special needs.</p>
<p>Finally, we can choose the password to encrypt our external storage. </p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/Selection_067.png" alt="veracrypt_password" width="800" height="514" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_067-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_067-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_067-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_067-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_067-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_067-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>We can also check the "Use PIM" and the "Use keyfiles" options. The PIM (personal iterations multiplier) is a number that will be used in addition to our password to encrypt the storage and will be necessary to decrypt it. It adds another layer of security to our drive and reduces the chances to unlock it with brute force attacks. When using shorter passwords than 20 characters, PIM's value can't be lower than 485.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/Selection_068.png" alt="PIM" width="800" height="511" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_068-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_068-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_068-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_068-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_068-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_068-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>We could also add a Keyfile, a file that we have to provide when we want to unlock our volume. We should use this feature when we are unlocking our device only from a few computers because it would force us to carry the file with us on an unencrypted storage in any place we will need to unlock our encrypted storage. Also when working with live environments like Anu₿itux, it would force us to retrieve the file from another source any time we need to unlock our device.</p>
<p>In the last step, we can choose the Filesystem of our device. We can also choose to use the "Quick Format" option. It should be used only with new devices because it will not overwrite all the memory portions of them and could allow someone to recover some information that was stored previously. Remember that encrypting big disks could take several hours.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/Selection_069.png" alt="veracrypt_quick" width="800" height="512" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_069-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_069-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_069-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_069-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_069-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_069-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Now, clicking on the next button, Veracrypt will collect entropy from the movements of our mouse and then the formatting process will begin.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/Selection_070.png" alt="veracrypt_entropy" width="800" height="506" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_070-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_070-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_070-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_070-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_070-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_070-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<h3>Create an encrypted volume</h3>
<p>When creating an encrypted volume, the procedure is almost the same. At the start point, from the "VeraCrypt Volume Creation Wizard", we have to select the "Create an encrypted file container" option.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/Selection_071.png" alt="veracrypt_2" width="800" height="513" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_071-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_071-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_071-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_071-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_071-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_071-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Then, in the location menu, we have to select where to store the container and choose a name for it.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/Screenshot_20221126_182352.png" alt="volume_name" width="800" height="657" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Screenshot_20221126_182352-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Screenshot_20221126_182352-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Screenshot_20221126_182352-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Screenshot_20221126_182352-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Screenshot_20221126_182352-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Screenshot_20221126_182352-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Now we only have to choose the size of our volume and then we can follow the same steps we have seen above.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/Screenshot_20221126_182544.png" alt="veracrypt_size" width="800" height="513" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Screenshot_20221126_182544-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Screenshot_20221126_182544-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Screenshot_20221126_182544-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Screenshot_20221126_182544-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Screenshot_20221126_182544-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Screenshot_20221126_182544-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<h3>Unlock VeraCrypt volumes</h3>
<p>Access a volume we have encrypted with VeraCrypt is very easy. After starting the tool, we have to choose a location to mount the volume from the list of numbers. Then we have to click on the "Select file..." button if we want to mount a container or on the "Select Device..." button if we want to mount an encrypted storage.</p>
<p>Then we have to click on the Mount button, provide the password and the PIM (if we set it up when creating the volume) and all is done.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/Screenshot_20221126_183645.png" alt="veracrypt_mount" width="600" height="680" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Screenshot_20221126_183645-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Screenshot_20221126_183645-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Screenshot_20221126_183645-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Screenshot_20221126_183645-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Screenshot_20221126_183645-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Screenshot_20221126_183645-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Now can access our volume with our file manager, like a common external device.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/Screenshot_20221126_183812.png" alt="volume" width="1000" height="576" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Screenshot_20221126_183812-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Screenshot_20221126_183812-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Screenshot_20221126_183812-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Screenshot_20221126_183812-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Screenshot_20221126_183812-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Screenshot_20221126_183812-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p class="msg msg--info">When we do not need the volume anymore, we should always dismount it from the VeraCrypt user interface, using the proper button. </p>
<h3>Final thoughts</h3>
<p>Veracrypt gives us a safe way to store information and files and access them from almost any desktop operating system. We have always to consider that adding security to our information requires a bigger caution from our side since if we lose or forget the encryption password or the PIM we have set up, it could be impossible to <a href="https://anubitux.org/try-to-unlock-a-veracrypt-volume-with-anubitux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recover our information</a>. So it is recommended to use passwords we can always remember or we can always access in a safe way.</p>

                    <p><img src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/25/quantitatives-dV7UYaPtv6w-unsplash.jpg" class="type:primaryImage" alt="" /></p>
                <p>Using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, all the transactions we make will stay in the blockchain forever and ever and anyone will be able to check them. Knowing what to look to, it could be possible to perform an investigation of our transactions. Let's see an example of a chain analysis investigation proposed on the <a href="https://osintops.com/blockchain-pat-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">osintops.com</a> blog and performed starting from a <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/3c4c026ce8a285ddc281f78e5f9d00df2c19d627904165696faf8263a6f34761" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">transaction</a> pointed out in <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/how-tos/2019/02/01/tracking-illicit-transactions-with-blockchain-a-guide-featuring-mueller/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this article</a> written by Brenna Smith.</p>
<p>The transaction, according to <a href="https://www.justice.gov/file/1080281/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this document</a>, was carried out by a group of Russian secret agents and was intended to manipulate the work of the US Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign.</p>
<p>Performing such analysis there are two main questions that we need to answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>where are the bitcoins from?</li>
<li>where were they sent?</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach should allow us to identify not so much who managed the bitcoins but rather who could provide us with some information about it, like exchanges and payment processors. Indeed, even if we know that blockchains do not store personal information, nowadays it is almost essential to interact with online services by performing KYC (<em>know your customer</em>) procedures when handling cryptocurrencies.</p>
<h3>Where are the bitcoins from?</h3>
<p>To find an answer to this question we will use one of the many blockchain explorers available: <a href="https://bitcoinwhoswho.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bitcoinwhoswho.com</a>. This service is able to provide additional information about the addresses we are checking (scam reports, links to web pages where they are mentioned, information about the owner, etc.).</p>
<p>In combination we will use <a href="https://www.walletexplorer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">walletexplorer.com</a>: this service uses algorithms that could associate bitcoin addresses with others to reconstruct a wallet and relate it to known entities such as exchanges, darknet markets, gambling sites, etc.</p>
<p>The transaction used to start this analysis was disposed by the address 1LQv8aKtQoiY5M5zkaG8RWL7LMwNzVaVqR. Unfortunately, in this case, the analysis of the address via bitcoinwhoswho.com did not provide any additional information.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image001-800x297.png" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image001-800x297.png 800w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image001-300x111.png 300w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image001-768x285.png 768w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image001.png 1152w" alt="" width="800" height="297" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>We can also observe that the address was involved in only two transactions, one incoming and one outgoing.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image003-800x130.png" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image003-800x130.png 800w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image003-300x49.png 300w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image003-768x124.png 768w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image003.png 1142w" alt="" width="800" height="130" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>Even <a href="https://www.walletexplorer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">walletexplorer.com</a> is not able to provide us any useful information: the wallet consisting of the address being analyzed alone cannot be connected to any known name, nor is any further bitcoin address aggregated that could be associated with the same user.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image005.png" sizes="(max-width: 712px) 100vw, 712px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image005.png 712w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image005-300x67.png 300w" alt="" width="700" height="157" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>To continue finding an answer to our question, let's take another look at the transactions in which the address 1LQv8aKtQoiY5M5zkaG8RWL7LMwNzVaVqR was involved.</p>
<p> The incoming transaction, indicated by the green arrow, comes from the address <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/1HF9VgN3AcA5RJd6ZUPnXdETmFbYmikveN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1HF9VgN3AcA5RJd6ZUPnXdETmFbYmikveN</a>.</p>
<p>This address also made only two transactions of which it is not possible to obtain additional information either via bitcoinwhoswho.com or walletexplorer.com.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image007-800x146.png" sizes="(max-width: 733px) 100vw, 733px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image007-800x146.png 800w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image007-300x55.png 300w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image007.png 1164w" alt="" width="800" height="145" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>So, with the same approach, let's continue to analyze the address that sent bitcoins to the one we are looking to, checking them with bitcoinwhoswho.com and walletexplorer.com.</p>
<p>Doing so, we will encounter this addresses:</p>
<ul>
<li>1Fj4RkrtnnMn5mBtQFW5ZkzEw4vGyCoRe9;</li>
<li>1KSkbN7JHYxBSoYwuuWuzA4dpZf9TKP6V8;</li>
<li>1AB99VvWeLtRcEZ6yubX1Cqvcvi4bPH6R6;</li>
<li>13ZMs871ZBcTTauhXDpRQ6hDaTaPcPVmTY;</li>
<li>1MS4KRpKakzTEUFzcU9PHCbs2f1u9a1aL4;</li>
<li>1MYQzejdwhiU83qy4SsLKcm7CwV5XxVFRn;</li>
<li>1ECFBdcnfhVWcGG6k4p4Pt4J9ciQsK8wEn;</li>
<li>1GN5ZGGQsgQGQdP5Yc2LAWUKssrLk5YRbc;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/1KgUcHDuWLVzFxVnwp3u5jZw3FmorjG1jD">1KgUcHDuWLVzFxVnwp3u5jZw3FmorjG1jD</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The last address, unlike what happens with the others, receives bitcoins from four different addresses.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image009-1024x205.png" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image009-1024x205.png 1024w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image009-300x60.png 300w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image009-768x154.png 768w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image009.png 1159w" alt="" width="800" height="160" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>These addresses seem to be involved in an intenser activity. Walletexplorer.com clusters all 4 addresses in the wallet with ID <a href="https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/0001d2e72691ea9d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">0001d2e726</a>, whose activities are mostly inbound transactions attributable to the exchange <a href="https://cex.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cex.io</a>.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image011.png" sizes="(max-width: 971px) 100vw, 971px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image011.png 971w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image011-300x296.png 300w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image011-768x757.png 768w" alt="" width="800" height="788" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>So, we are now able to state that the transactions we are looking to involve bitcoins that were purchased through the Cex.io exchange.</p>
<h3>Where were the bitcoins sent?</h3>
<p>Now let's take a look at the transactions disposed by the owners of the bitcoins after they bought them at Cex.io. Looking at the addresses we have encountered by now, we can see that every time there is an outgoing transaction sending coins to two addresses:</p>
<ul>
<li>one receiving a larger amount which is gradually carried forward from transaction to transaction;</li>
<li>one receiving a smaller amount, which often consists of more decimal digits. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Peel chains</h4>
<p>This transactions schema is usually called peel chain. In peel chains, users send bitcoin to an intended destination address, maybe because they are paying something, and receive the remaining part, named change, on a new address that is in their control. This happens because the Bitcoin protocol does not allow to spend any desired amount but only allows to forward amounts that were previously received and have not yet been involved in transactions. These amounts are called UTxOs (unspent transaction outputs).</p>
<p>Analyzing peel chains can give us two kinds of information:</p>
<ul>
<li>we can collect a lot of addresses belonging to the target of our identification;</li>
<li>we will encounter a lot of payments made by the target of our investigations and, some of them could lead us to new evidence regarding our target.</li>
</ul>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Concept-Diagram_EN-1.png" sizes="(max-width: 481px) 100vw, 481px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Concept-Diagram_EN-1.png 481w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Concept-Diagram_EN-1-300x115.png 300w" alt="" width="481" height="184" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>The main challenge in this kind of analysis is to determine which address is receiving the change and which one is the recipient of the payment. This can be done by making <a href="https://anubitux.org/clustering-bitcoin-addresses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">considerations</a> on the amounts and the addresses involved. So, we should be able to determine, for any transaction, which address will receive the funds of the target of our investigation and which one is receiving their payment.</p>
<h4>How to go up the chain of transactions</h4>
<p>Let's start following the chain from the first address that received the bitcoins purchased from Cex.io. This is the starting point of the peel chain.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image014.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 643px) 100vw, 643px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image014.jpg 643w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image014-300x36.jpg 300w" alt="" width="640" height="77" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>In this case, the address that receives 0.8 bitcoin, 1N5hfyuGVZbTR78zXQ22kjUyCwZbgB8yhw, is most likely the actual destination address, while the address that receives 11.04445 bitcoin, 1GN5ZGGQsgQGQdP5Yc2LAWUKssrLk5YR, is the change address. It is very unlikely that a user could make a transaction of 11.04445 bitcoins (even by specifying the sending amount in FIAT currency on their client) and get a change of exactly 0.8 bitcoins.</p>
<p>Analyzing the address 1N5hfyuGVZbTR78zXQ22kjUyCwZbgB8yhw with walletexplorer.com, it is not traced back to any known person or entity.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image016.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 531px) 100vw, 531px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image016.jpg 531w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image016-300x44.jpg 300w" alt="" width="500" height="73" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>This does not mean that it is not possible to trace the address to an exchanger or a payment intermediary but rather that walletexplorer.com was unable to identify who presumably controls the address.</p>
<p>Continuing to follow the sequence of payments, observing the transaction made from the change address 1GN5ZGGQsgQGQdP5Yc2LAWUKssrLk5YRbc and considering the behavior assumed in the other transactions examined, we can assume that the actual recipient is the address 1Mut7bPWhQS2NkTQ6wUpRtbV65vyELBqcs and the change address is 1ECFBdcnfhVWcGG6k4p4Pt4J9ciQsK8wEn.</p>
<p> </p>
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image018.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 643px) 100vw, 643px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image018.jpg 643w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image018-300x25.jpg 300w" alt="" width="640" height="54" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></div>
<p>Analyzing the information provided by walletexplorer.com, confirming what we hypothesized a little while ago, 1Mut7bPWhQS2NkTQ6wUpRtbV65vyELBqcs is traced back to the payment intermediary BitPay.com.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image020.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 530px) 100vw, 530px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image020.jpg 530w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image020-300x42.jpg 300w" alt="" width="530" height="74" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></div>
<p>Now, look at the outgoing transaction made from the address 1ECFBdcnfhVWcGG6k4p4Pt4J9ciQsK8wEn.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image022.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image022.jpg 642w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image022-300x24.jpg 300w" alt="Transazione 3" width="640" height="52" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></div>
<p>We assume, with the same criteria adopted for the previous transactions, that the destination address is 1ChwFk9Wtq7zav6TRnxE8e8xgf5daFXV5D, while the change address is 1MYQzejdwhiU83qy4SsLKcm7CwV5XxVFRn. Also, in this case, walletexplorer.com was unable to link it to any known service.</p>
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image024.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 527px) 100vw, 527px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image024.jpg 527w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image024-300x35.jpg 300w" alt="Wallet Explorer 3" width="520" height="60" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></div>
<p>Continuing along the flow of transactions, analyzing the transactions disposed by every encountered change address, we can find the following destination addresses:</p>
<ul>
<li>13ov4UBJYJQBC1Tv5vEvijShn2vWS3vPrJ, not attributable to any entity;</li>
<li>1Atc1n6rCm7GMpW1JsRuwF8b2hWQJjxi6i, not attributable to any entity, but recipient of an unusually high amount equal to 5 bitcoins;</li>
<li>13DD8uH3FMZbJjXnSgZfL2MMTxesT9qUgJ, not attributable to any entity but grouped with other 6 addresses that could be further examined;</li>
<li>1Hy8Comf7wyBtqgGzph3fX8Ky6S5t8eXeh, attributable to the same wallet as the address in the previous point;</li>
<li>1DLTLvpev16LemyDtuyEL2WnyLskcPSvKM, attributable to CoinPayments.net;</li>
</ul>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image026.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image026.jpg 533w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image026-300x37.jpg 300w" alt="" width="530" height="65" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<ul>
<li>1J8LeRgSwuHqfJuFX3Uo62WnDNFsNuAygR, attributable to BitPay.com;</li>
</ul>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image028.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 535px) 100vw, 535px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image028.jpg 535w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image028-300x41.jpg 300w" alt="" width="530" height="72" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<ul>
<li>1Jkoon938Pe66whJgZZwxn6zzjKMLkFRCX, not attributable to any entity;</li>
<li>14mUSXvddwR9qgBr93BGXEAcgRw84jEtaG, not attributable to any entity;</li>
<li>1NZ4MSeYcDKFiPRt8h7VK6XMhShwzhCzCp, not attributable to any entity.</li>
</ul>
<p>This last address is the one that received the transaction from the address 1LQv8aKtQoiY5M5zkaG8RWL7LMwNzVaVqR, cited in the article from which we began our analysis.</p>
<h4>Let's recap</h4>
<p>Returning to the main discourse, in the following image, we can graphically observe what we have reconstructed so far with our analysis. The change addresses are represented by circles that get smaller and smaller, to represent the part of bitcoin that is used to make payments.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Grafo-Parte2.png" sizes="(max-width: 974px) 100vw, 974px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Grafo-Parte2.png 974w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Grafo-Parte2-300x77.png 300w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Grafo-Parte2-768x197.png 768w" alt="" width="970" height="249" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<h4>What else should we look at?</h4>
<p>To obtain more information, the aforementioned wallet of seven addresses, including 13DD8uH3FMZbJjXnSgZfL2MMTxesT9qUgJ and 1Hy8Comf7wyBtqgGzph3fX8Ky6S5t8eXeh, could be examined.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we can observe that the aforementioned address 1Atc1n6rCm7GMpW1JsRuwF8b2hWQJjxi6i, with the transaction made on 23 December 2015, receives 5.0 bitcoins, unlike other transactions where the amounts are much smaller. This could be a more substantial payment but, considering that less than 12 bitcoins were handled at the beginning of the transaction sequence, it could also be that the user of these addresses wanted to split the managed bitcoins and start another sequence of transactions. In fact, the following transaction is destined in favor of the addresses 1HbKVbT2k82JcMrvErwWMhJPGHjSo8iLBK and 1JX9Q7fqn9TajUe4F6vjWGtGnD2wqnXTii. Of these, the address 1HbKVbT2k82JcMrvErwWMhJPGHjSo8iLBK is associated, by walletexplorer.com, to the payment intermediary BitPay.com.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image030.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 528px) 100vw, 528px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image030.jpg 528w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image030-300x37.jpg 300w" alt="" width="500" height="62" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<h3>And now?</h3>
<p>Now we arrived at the starting point of our analysis and we were able to determine that the target of our investigation bought bitcoins from Cex.io and made many payments, also using payment processors like BitPay.com and CoinPayments.com. So, let's take a look at what our targets made with their bitcoins after the aforementioned transaction.</p>
<p>We can see that the transactions continue with the same pattern: one address receives a lower bitcoin amount and with fewer decimal digits and another receives the so-called change of the transaction, a higher amount and with more decimal places.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image001-1-1024x93.png" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image001-1-1024x93.png 1024w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image001-1-300x27.png 300w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image001-1-768x70.png 768w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image001-1.png 1134w" alt="" width="800" height="73" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>With the same rules used up to now, we can state that the address 1NZ4MSeYcDKFiPRt8h7VK6XMhShwzhCzCp is the one that receives the bitcoins, while the address 1AK79g9gpvZ8jn2C9MsWQpijMFA5JaTdqP is the one that receives the remainder of the transaction.</p>
<p>In this case, <a href="https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/2cba7ba8b8d067d6?from_address=1NZ4MSeYcDKFiPRt8h7VK6XMhShwzhCzCp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">walletexplorer.com</a> does not give us any information on the destination address.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image003-1.png" sizes="(max-width: 803px) 100vw, 803px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image003-1.png 803w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image003-1-300x103.png 300w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image003-1-768x265.png 768w" alt="" width="800" height="276" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>Now let's look to the change address 1AK79g9gpvZ8jn2C9MsWQpijMFA5JaTdqP with bitcoinwhoswho.com.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image005-1-1024x164.png" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image005-1-1024x164.png 1024w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image005-1-300x48.png 300w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image005-1-768x123.png 768w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image005-1.png 1144w" alt="" width="800" height="128" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>Also in this case the situation is the same seen in most of the cases of our analysis. By now we shouldn’t have difficulty recognizing that the address 153LqeB1mQa8xDaQDyvhWTCNweVTDeH9BE is the actual destination of the payment while the address 1RBiVomgGeqqRm4NQkJhmffWtAfJDdjFr receives the change. So let’s see what <a href="https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/CoinPayments.net?from_address=153LqeB1mQa8xDaQDyvhWTCNweVTDeH9BE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">walletexplorer.com</a> can tell us about the payment destination address.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image007-1.png" sizes="(max-width: 722px) 100vw, 722px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image007-1.png 722w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image007-1-300x42.png 300w" alt="" width="700" height="97" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>In this case, the address was traced to CoinPayments.net. Let’s continue with our analysis and see what happens in the subsequent transactions. To do this we need to analyze the transactions made by the address 1RBiVomgGeqqRm4NQkJhmffWtAfJDdjFr.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image009-1-1024x180.png" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image009-1-1024x180.png 1024w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image009-1-300x53.png 300w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image009-1-768x135.png 768w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image009-1.png 1151w" alt="" width="800" height="141" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>If we search for the destination address with <a href="https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/00009799370b78be?from_address=1MM3YT9khXudNqgUxUXSPHhA2RHKoS37iv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">walletexplorer.com</a>, we notice that it is not traced back to any known entity, but is still associated with a wallet with great activity, 211.023 transactions! Similar behavior is typical of an exchange or payment intermediary. It is difficult to imagine a person carrying out such several transactions.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image011-1.png" sizes="(max-width: 975px) 100vw, 975px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image011-1.png 975w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image011-1-300x114.png 300w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image011-1-768x292.png 768w" alt="" width="800" height="304" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>Going forward, observing the transactions carried out from the change address identified from time to time, we will notice the following payment destination addresses:</p>
<ul>
<li>1AV6NxfKYTwDSqbcGFn76KtAFHwCDYScHi, not related to any entity, but associated with the same wallet with ID 0000979937 of the previous case;</li>
<li>1G85zgoQu1VeEaH4gQwyfS9VQqUxBJD6bb, not linked to any entity, but associated with the same wallet with ID 0000979937 of the previous cases;</li>
<li>1MYQwTsamJ18WnaeggkF4Tboms5ySHp2VA, not linked to any entity, but associated with the same wallet with ID 0000979937 of the previous cases;</li>
<li>1PQAL7HxjzuoKVAbbTijkZ3mPZWhtgEjYM, not related to any entity, but associated with the same wallet with ID 0000979937 of the previous cases;</li>
<li>1MRFjrnChHPMP9WH797Tg27eZNzQexQW6S, not attributed to any entity;</li>
<li>1EMVNB1aGTdL48oi2T6t4wZLUDQ9Kc5ddv, not linked to any entity, but associated with the same wallet with ID 0000979937 of the previous cases.</li>
</ul>
<p>Continuing, we arrive at the address 1HvWTwViSsy8j5Z9QWCGKKFiSCgDe1uLAM, which receives the change of the previous transactions. Looking closely at the transaction amounts, it could seem a bit strange.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image013-1024x179.png" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image013-1024x179.png 1024w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image013-300x52.png 300w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image013-768x134.png 768w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image013.png 1150w" alt="" width="800" height="140" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>Indeed, the address seems to receive 1.37587747 bitcoins, but it spends 2.70223736! It seems absurd. Instead, it is a deceptive display of information provided by bitcoinwhoswho.com. The service only displays information strictly related to the address you searched for. To understand what happened, we must first note the string 23e7879eaa2c2757d049f1a22a176dda4907be407aa70fdcc3ea4a5b57754f52 written above the “anomalous” transaction. This is the transaction identifier, called hash. To be able to understand it we need to query another blockchain explorer, for example, <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blockchain.com</a>.<br><br>By doing so, we can see that the address 1HvWTwViSsy8j5Z9QWCGKKFiSCgDe1uLAM is not the only sender of the transaction.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/25/Selection_011-2.png" alt="" width="800" height="120" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/25/responsive/Selection_011-2-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/25/responsive/Selection_011-2-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/25/responsive/Selection_011-2-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/25/responsive/Selection_011-2-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/25/responsive/Selection_011-2-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/25/responsive/Selection_011-2-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>The bitcoins also come from the address 16xyGaTT2dQipfhUz8rNPR4L98xx7zQ9Et. If a transaction comes from two addresses or more addresses, the person who made it must have the private keys of all of them to sign it. In this case, we can therefore say that the user has both addresses, or that both addresses are part of the same wallet.</p>
<p>Note that the address 16xyGaTT2dQipfhUz8rNPR4L98xx7zQ9Et already had some bitcoins available when we encountered it. So this address will also have its own history and flow of transactions. If we begin to observe the transactions linked to this flow, we notice that the behavior is almost identical to that seen so far.</p>
<p>Our address receives its bitcoins from the address 17SLcA24f4s3RXupPWWAdJsfJcdhyRivfF.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image017-1024x157.png" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image017-1024x157.png 1024w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image017-300x46.png 300w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image017-768x118.png 768w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image017.png 1140w" alt="" width="800" height="123" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>This address, continuing backward, receives the bitcoins from the address 17GKzWc4m7kEPxvoHAtPisvtZ7Qnk2sMd and carries out a single outbound transaction, of which the address 1ZeSmMCHFqd6Gg8y3NhrChVTyTPbUkneJ that receives 0.144816 bitcoin is that of the actual destination and the address 16xyGaTT2dQipfhUz8rNPR4L98xx7zQ9Et that receives 1.32640989 bitcoin is the change one.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image019-1024x158.png" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image019-1024x158.png 1024w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image019-300x46.png 300w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image019-768x118.png 768w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image019.png 1144w" alt="" width="800" height="123" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>By going backward, we can try to get to the point where these bitcoins may have been bought. Using the same techniques we have seen so far we can see that the bitcoins come from the same wallet linked to Cex.io, which we met in the first part, with ID 0001d2e726 on walletexplorer.com.</p>
<p>Here is an image that can help to understand what is happening. There are two flows of transactions that start from the Cex.io exchange (this suggests us there were two purchases made by our targets from that exchange): one is the one we followed in the first two parts of our analysis and one is the one we have just encountered. The two flows merge when the bitcoins in the availability of the addresses 1ZeSmMCHFqd6Gg8y3NhrChVTyTPbUkneJ and 16xyGaTT2dQipfhUz8rNPR4L98xx7zQ9Et are used to carry out the same transaction.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Concept-Diagram_EN_P3-800x336.png" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Concept-Diagram_EN_P3-800x336.png 800w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Concept-Diagram_EN_P3-300x126.png 300w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Concept-Diagram_EN_P3-768x323.png 768w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Concept-Diagram_EN_P3.png 862w" alt="" width="800" height="336" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>So far we have only taken care of the senders of the transaction where we noticed the cospending by two addresses. But let's also take a look at the recipients of the transaction.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image023.png" sizes="(max-width: 691px) 100vw, 691px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image023.png 691w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image023-300x41.png 300w" alt="" width="650" height="88" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>We find the address 1DqYiuVPjxrS3tkE8VeSorvx4ZEeR3oGkZ, which receives 0.20223736 bitcoins, and the address 1AgEeJ1cNWpXxABaTysv4CM6MqARSnXFce, which receives exactly 2.5.</p>
<p>With the criteria adopted so far, we will certainly agree that the address that receives 2.5 bitcoins is the actual destination. We said that a user is unlikely to want to make a transaction by specifying an amount of 8 decimal places, resulting in a change of exactly 2.5 bitcoins.</p>
<p>In this case, we can strengthen our claim considering that we have seen two sender addresses. If a user wanted to transfer 0.20223736 bitcoins it would not make sense to use both the sender. In fact, at the time of the transaction, observing the history of transactions received by each of the senders, the address 16xyGaTT2dQipfhUz8rNPR4L98xx7zQ9Et had 1,32640989 bitcoins available.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image025-1024x72.png" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image025-1024x72.png 1024w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image025-300x21.png 300w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image025-768x54.png 768w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image025.png 1142w" alt="" width="800" height="56" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>and the address 1HvWTwViSsy8j5Z9QWCGKKFiSCgDe1uLAM had 1.3758774 bitcoins available.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image027-1024x66.png" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image027-1024x66.png 1024w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image027-300x19.png 300w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image027-768x50.png 768w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image027.png 1141w" alt="" width="800" height="52" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>So we can assume that our target had the intention to transfer 2.5 bitcoins. If the user of the addresses had wanted to transfer only 0.20223736 bitcoins, it would have been enough for him to use only one of the two addresses.</p>
<p>Since we have found abnormal behavior compared to what we have seen so far, we need to carefully analyze what both destination addresses do: we could find ourselves in front of either a more substantial payment, or a consolidation transaction, that is, a transaction carried out to collect the balances available on multiple addresses in one.</p>
<p>Continuing to analyze our flow of transactions, from the address 1DqYiuVPjxrS3tkE8VeSorvx4ZEeR3oGkZ we will find a situation similar to what we have seen by now, with transactions that have two destinations addresses, a recipient and a change.</p>
<p>In the picture, we can see a reconstruction of what's happening.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Concept-Diagram_EN_P4-800x455.png" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Concept-Diagram_EN_P4-800x455.png 800w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Concept-Diagram_EN_P4-300x171.png 300w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Concept-Diagram_EN_P4-768x437.png 768w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Concept-Diagram_EN_P4.png 972w" alt="" width="800" height="455" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>Continuing to follow the peel chain as we did so far, we will find the address 155HWPsNcBGxMuMgiQjhAUD2ggCMGLVm9X.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/immagine-1.png" sizes="(max-width: 721px) 100vw, 721px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/immagine-1.png 721w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/immagine-1-300x213.png 300w" alt="" width="700" height="497" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>The address was only involved in an incoming transaction. The actual amount, 0.00003139 is so small that the user has probably decided to don’t use it anymore.</p>
<p>At this point, we can say that we have followed a flow of bitcoins in which multiple transactions were made to different payment processors, gradually reducing the amount that was carried forward as change, up to an amount of practically zero and above all point where the flow of transactions stops.</p>
<h4>The 2.5 bitcoins transactions</h4>
<p>We do not have to forget that we have yet to observe where the 2.5 bitcoin transaction mentioned above went.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/25/Selection_012.png" alt="" width="800" height="118" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/25/responsive/Selection_012-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/25/responsive/Selection_012-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/25/responsive/Selection_012-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/25/responsive/Selection_012-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/25/responsive/Selection_012-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/25/responsive/Selection_012-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>In this part of our analysis, let’s see what happens to the 2.5 bitcoins transferred. Such a precise amount was certainly intentionally transferred, it is not a random change. However, in most of the transactions examined so far, we have seen much smaller amounts sent to the actual recipients. Therefore, it is good practice in an analysis of any kind, to pay more attention to all those behaviors that “break” the regularity, trying to identify the reasons that could have given rise to the anomaly.</p>
<p>Let’s immediately start looking at what has been done with the address we are examining.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image003-800x97.png" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image003-800x97.png 800w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image003-300x36.png 300w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image003-768x93.png 768w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image003.png 1159w" alt="" width="800" height="97" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>The address was involved in a single outgoing transaction, in favor of two addresses: 1J8kvixEnAnGDEDwkfqJS246sXdW1mhkvB, which receives 0.99805659 bitcoins, and 1NPgLU4sVj5ww2UZ8DktDSYm7kLJN6sYq1, which receives 1.501685 bitcoins. In this case, it is not at all easy to understand which of the two is the actual destination address and which is the change address. A single sender address is involved, which spends all the available balance, and both destination addresses receive an amount with 8 decimal digits.</p>
<p>So, to avoid that we can miss something, we must carefully examine both addresses, looking for behaviors similar to those already seen so far or for interactions with known entities.</p>
<h5>First recipient address</h5>
<p>Let’s start by observing the behavior of the address 1J8kvixEnAnGDEDwkfqJS246sXdW1mhkvB, which received 0.99805659 bitcoins.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/immagine-10-800x352.png" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/immagine-10-800x352.png 800w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/immagine-10-300x132.png 300w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/immagine-10-768x338.png 768w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/immagine-10.png 843w" alt="" width="800" height="352" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>Unlike what we have seen so far, this address received an amount of almost one bitcoin but did not spend it. In these cases, checking the address with <a href="https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/89f0e040d9c409ad?from_address=1J8kvixEnAnGDEDwkfqJS246sXdW1mhkvB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">walletexplorer.com</a> will not give great results. The data shown by this service are based on the activity that was done with the addresses. In this case, since there has been practically no activity, it will not be possible to group this address with others or to trace it back to known entities.</p>
<p>This is a new situation, we have an address that has a substantial amount of bitcoins and has not yet spent them. This does not mean that the user, from one day to the next, cannot decide to use this address to carry out a new transaction and provide us with new information.</p>
<p>However, even if in this case we have only one address to observe, as it could carry out transactions, it is not at all practical to think of checking every day if the balance has changed.</p>
<p>In such cases, we can take advantage of a service that is right for us, offered by the <a href="https://www.blockonomics.co/blockonomics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blockonomics</a> site. Once we have created a free account, we have a service called “Wallet Watcher”, which allows us to keep an eye on multiple addresses simultaneously.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image009-800x158.png" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image009.png 800w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image009-300x59.png 300w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image009-768x152.png 768w" alt="" width="800" height="158" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>We can add multiple addresses and label them for easy recognition. From the settings tab, ticking the appropriate box we will receive an e-mail alert whenever one of the observed addresses is involved in any activity.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image011.png" sizes="(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image011.png 632w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image011-300x168.png 300w" alt="" width="600" height="336" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<h5>Second recipient address</h5>
<p>Continuing our analysis, let’s now look at the address 1NPgLU4sVj5ww2UZ8DktDSYm7kLJN6sYq1 which received 1.50168541 bitcoin, in the transaction reported at the beginning of this part of our analysis.</p>
<p>In this case, the bitcoins were all spent, in a single transaction.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/25/Selection_013.png" alt="" width="800" height="406" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/25/responsive/Selection_013-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/25/responsive/Selection_013-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/25/responsive/Selection_013-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/25/responsive/Selection_013-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/25/responsive/Selection_013-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/25/responsive/Selection_013-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>This is a single transaction that sees 11 other addresses among the senders and was carried out in favor of 6 other addresses. In our analysis, we have never encountered a transaction involving so many addresses. Instead of starting immediately to examine all the addresses, grouping them in a single wallet and observing each of them where it got its bitcoins, let’s try to understand who we are in front of. Let’s search our address with <a href="https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/0001c7f9dcc8ba8f?from_address=1NPgLU4sVj5ww2UZ8DktDSYm7kLJN6sYq1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">walletexplorer.com</a>.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image014-800x521.png" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image014-800x521.png 800w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image014-300x196.png 300w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image014-768x501.png 768w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image014.png 827w" alt="" width="800" height="521" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>As we can see, walletexplorer.com has grouped the address in a wallet that has carried out 232.621 transactions! It is a wallet that, based on the reconstructions carried out by the algorithms of walletexplorer.com, contains 37.632 addresses, too many for a single person.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image016.png" sizes="(max-width: 766px) 100vw, 766px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image016.png 766w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image016-300x163.png 300w" alt="" width="750" height="408" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>Let’s go back for a moment to the previous image, which shows the activity carried out with the wallet which includes the address we are examining. As we can see, outgoing transactions are directed to <a href="https://spectrocoin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spectrocoin.com</a>.</p>
<p>What could have happened?</p>
<p>Let’s start by understanding what spectrocoin.com is. It is an online service that allows you to exchange different types of virtual currencies with each other or to buy and sell them using FIAT currencies.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/25/Selection_014.png" alt="" width="700" height="872" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/25/responsive/Selection_014-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/25/responsive/Selection_014-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/25/responsive/Selection_014-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/25/responsive/Selection_014-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/25/responsive/Selection_014-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/25/responsive/Selection_014-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>However, the currencies displayed at the time of the analysis may be different from those accepted at the time of the transaction. Let’s try to understand what the situation was at the time of the transaction, therefore, approximately, in  April 2016. To do this we can use a service called <a href="https://web.archive.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WayBack Machine</a>. Let’s search the spectrocoin.com page and view the available data.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image020-800x410.png" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image020-800x410.png 800w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image020-300x154.png 300w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image020-768x394.png 768w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image020.png 1133w" alt="" width="800" height="410" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>There are various data relating to 2016. In particular, there is a capture of the site that dates back to April 8, coincidentally the day on which the transaction we are studying was carried out.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image022-800x264.png" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image022.png 800w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image022-300x99.png 300w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image022-768x253.png 768w" alt="" width="800" height="264" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>As we can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160325153601/https:/spectrocoin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">see</a>, at the time of the transaction, the site only supported Bitcoin and no other virtual currency. In particular, the site could be only used to buy and sell bitcoins.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image024-800x356.png" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" srcset="https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image024-800x356.png 800w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image024-300x133.png 300w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image024-768x342.png 768w, https://osintops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image024.png 881w" alt="" width="800" height="356" loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></figure>
<p>At this point, we can assume that the 1.50168541 bitcoins transaction, carried out to the address 1NPgLU4sVj5ww2UZ8DktDSYm7kLJN6sYq1, was aimed at exchanging bitcoins into FIAT currency or making a payment through the SpectroCoin virtual card. Unfortunately, at this point, the information is no longer present in the blockchain but is in the exclusive availability of those who manage spectrocoin.com.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Starting with a single bitcoin transaction, we were able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>identify other related transaction flows;</li>
<li>understand that the bitcoins were probably purchased from the Cex.io exchange;</li>
<li>reconstruct the scheme by which bitcoins were regularly used to send payments through BitPay.com and CoinPayments.com, following the rest of the transactions;</li>
<li>follow a flow of transactions until its exhaustion;</li>
<li>identify when bitcoins have likely been converted back into FIAT currency via SpectroCoin.com.</li>
</ul>
<p>The analysis we conducted started with a casual transaction. The scenario in front of us is always unpredictable. The more tools we master, the greater chances we will have of being able to productively analyze any scenario we will encounter.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, once we arrive at an exchange, it would unlikely share information about its customers with us, unless we can use the powers of the law Enforcement Agencies or of the Judiciary.</p>

            <![CDATA[
                    <p><img src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/python-gbd1e5efef_1920.jpg" class="type:primaryImage" alt="" /></p>
                <p>When coding with Python, one of the bigger matters we have to deal with its dependencies. With a community as big as Python's one, this problem couldn't remain unsolved! In fact, we can use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">virtual environments</a>, a solution that allows us to execute every Python script with its own version of the libraries it uses. This helps us to avoid conflicts between scripts needing different versions of the same library or between incompatible libraries.</p>
<h3>How virtual environments work </h3>
<p>First of all, we need to install Python virtual environments to be able to use them. To do that we can simply run:</p>
<p><code>pip3 install venv</code></p>
<p>Now, when we write a Python script or download some from <a href="https://github.com/search?l=Python&amp;q=python&amp;type=Repositories" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>, like one of <a href="https://github.com/ASeriousMister" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ours</a>, we can open our Terminal and change the working directory with the path of the tool:</p>
<p><code>cd /home/anubitux/Tools/python_tool</code></p>
<p>Now, let's create our virtual environment:</p>
<p><code>virtualenv demo</code></p>
<p>This is going to create a python virtual environment named "demo", that will be placed in a newly created folder in the tool's directory.</p>
<p>At this point, we need to activate it, and all the libraries we are going to install will only be used within our virtual environment:</p>
<p><code>source demo/bin/activate</code></p>
<p>Now, to be sure our virtual environment is active, we can see its name in brackets on the left of our username in our terminal.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/Selection_055.png" alt="venv1" width="900" height="143" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/responsive/Selection_055-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/responsive/Selection_055-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/responsive/Selection_055-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/responsive/Selection_055-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/responsive/Selection_055-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/responsive/Selection_055-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Now we can install our libraries, running</p>
<p><code>pip3 -r install requirements.txt</code></p>
<p>if the tool we are going to use has a list of dependencies placed in the conventional <em>requirements.txt</em> file, or simply running</p>
<p><code>pip3 install python_library_name</code></p>
<p>When our environment is ready, we can run our tool:</p>
<p><code>python3 demo_tool.py</code></p>
<p>If we are done, we can stop our virtual environment running:</p>
<p><code>deactivate</code></p>
<p>So the virtual environment's name in brackets will disappear.</p>
<h3>How Anu₿itux uses virtual environments</h3>
<p>Anu₿itux uses many different <a href="https://anubitux.org/what-is-anubitux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Python tools</a>, some of them developed by our <a href="https://anubitux.org/meet-the-anubitux-project/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">team</a>, some of them developed by other trusted developers. Of course, our users wouldn't feel comfortable activating a different virtual environment every time they need to run a Python tool. So we adopted a solution suggested by our friends from the <a href="https://tsurugi-linux.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tsurugi Linux</a> team.</p>
<p>First of all, we created an environment for every single tool, with the procedure shown above. Then, to make sure that our tool is going to use it without the need to activate it, we placed its directory in the first commented line of every tool. This is the way to specify for every tool where it has to take the libraries it is going to use.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/Selection_056.png" alt="comment" width="500" height="109" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/responsive/Selection_056-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/responsive/Selection_056-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/responsive/Selection_056-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/responsive/Selection_056-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/responsive/Selection_056-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/responsive/Selection_056-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>in the example, <em>ssve</em> is the name we gave to the virtual environment.</p>
<p>It is important to indicate <em>python3</em> at the end of the line. This way we will be able to launch the tool without the need to specify it in the Terminal.</p>
<p class="msg msg--info">Doing that, it could happen that a python3 file is not available in the virtual environment folder. If so, we can place a <a href="https://linuxhint.com/create_symbolic_link_ubuntu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">symbolic link</a> into it pointing to <em>/usr/bin/python3</em>.</p>
<p>Now, to be able to run the tool without the need to go to its directory, using root privileges we'll add a symbolic link to it in a directory that is included in the $PATH system variable, like <em>/usr/bin</em>. The $PATH system variable controls where our system is going to look for the commands we enter in our Terminal.</p>
<p><code>sudo ln -s demo_tool.py /usr/bin/</code></p>
<p>Finally we need to add the execution rights to the symbolic link:</p>
<p><code>sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/demo_tool.py</code></p>
<p>Now, after restarting our Terminal, we will be able to run our tools as all the other commands we are used to!</p>
<h3>Something to pay attention to</h3>
<p>A lot of python tools do not use only libraries, but also some files placed in their folder. When launching them from our Terminal in any working directory, they won't be able to find those files. To solve this, we need to add a line to our python tool that makes its process run in the correct directory:</p>
<p><code>os.chdir('/path/of/the/tool')</code></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/Selection_057.png" alt="oschdir" width="450" height="61" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/responsive/Selection_057-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/responsive/Selection_057-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/responsive/Selection_057-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/responsive/Selection_057-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/responsive/Selection_057-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/responsive/Selection_057-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>

                    In a previous post, we have seen how to obtain a paper wallet by rolling a dice 256 times and tracking results with dicetracker.py, a tool developed by the Anu₿itux team. This tool supports the creation of paper wallets for many different currencies but not&hellip;

                    <p><img src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/dice-g609db9c73_1920.jpg" class="type:primaryImage" alt="" /></p>
                <p>In a <a href="https://anubitux.org/how-to-generate-random-paper-wallets-with-anubitux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">previous post</a>, we have seen how to obtain a paper wallet by rolling a dice 256 times and tracking results with <a href="https://github.com/ASeriousMister/DiceTracker.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dicetracker.py</a>, a tool developed by the Anu₿itux team. This tool supports the creation of paper wallets for many different currencies but not for all. Let's now see how to obtain a <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BIP39</a> valid mnemonic seed starting from the entropy obtained by rolling a dice many times. This way, we can use this mnemonic seed to <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">derive</a> private keys and addresses for many different kinds of coins. This is how this tool works!</p>
<h3>OpSec first!</h3>
<p>When generating a new mnemonic seed, it is very important to pay a lot of attention to the procedure we are using. If something goes wrong or if we leak some information, we could lose our coins. For this purpose, if we use it properly, Anu₿itux could give us great help.</p>
<p>Let's begin starting <a href="https://anubitux.org/how-to-use-anubitux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anu₿itux live</a> from our USB stick! Working in a live environment will leave no traces of what we are doing on the internal drives of our devices. Then, to be sure no information is leaving our devices, let's use the 'Offline' script placed on the upper left corner of our home screen.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/Selection_045.png" alt="offline" width="350" height="355" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_045-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_045-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_045-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_045-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_045-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_045-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Now, if we are in a safe place, without any recording device or indiscreet eyes around us, we can start generating our new mnemonic seed.</p>
<h3>Generating entropy</h3>
<p>First of all, let's start the tool <a href="https://github.com/ASeriousMister/Dice2Seed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dice2Seed.py</a>, by simply typing its name in our terminal window.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/Selection_047.png" alt="dice2seed1" width="900" height="179" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_047-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_047-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_047-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_047-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_047-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_047-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>The tool first of all asks us how many bits of entropy we want to obtain to generate our seed. This will affect the length of our <a href="https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/mnemonic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mnemonic seed</a>, according to the following scheme.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/Selection_048.png" alt="scheme" width="250" height="209" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_048-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_048-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_048-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_048-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_048-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_048-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>In the first column, we have the bits of entropy, in the second the bits of the checksum (obtained from <em>bits of entropy / 32</em>), in the third the length in bits of our seed and in the fourth the number of words of our mnemonic seed. This depends on how seeds are generated from entropy:</p>
<ul>
<li>sha256 hash is calculated on our entropy;</li>
<li>a checksum is obtained with a bit of the sha256 result for every 32 bits of entropy;</li>
<li>checksum is appended to entropy, giving us the seed;</li>
<li>seed is divided into groups of 11 bits (adding a bit every 32 bits of entropy, our seed's length will always a multiple of 33, that is itself a multiple of 11);</li>
<li>every 11 bits group is converted to decimals and gives us the index of the word in the <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/tree/master/bip-0039" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bip39 wordlists</a>, since a number of 11 can give a decimal between 0 and 2047. For this reason, we have 2048 words in the bip39 wordlists.</li>
</ul>
<p>In our case, let's hypothesize we want to obtain a mnemonic seed starting from 128 bits of entropy.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/Selection_049.png" alt="dice2seed2" width="900" height="227" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_049-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_049-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_049-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_049-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_049-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_049-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Now we will be prompted to paste the result of 128 previously made dice rolls or we can use the tool to track the rolls we are making while running it.</p>
<p>In this case, we will paste a 128 digits string, but we could also paste an entropy string made by 0s and 1s or use the tool to help us to track dice rolls.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/Selection_050.png" alt="dice2seed3" width="900" height="287" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_050-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_050-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_050-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_050-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_050-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_050-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<h3>Obtaining the mnemonic seed</h3>
<p>Now we only have to choose the language we prefer for our mnemonic seed, indicating the corresponding number, and mission complete! We obtained our mnemonic seed!</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/Selection_051.png" alt="dice2seed4" width="900" height="486" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_051-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_051-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_051-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_051-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_051-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_051-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<h3>How to use our seed</h3>
<p>Now we can use our seed accordingly to our needs:</p>
<ul>
<li>we could paste it in our BIP39 compatible wallet and start receiving and disposing transactions;</li>
<li>we can use it with our hardware wallet;</li>
<li>we can derive private keys and addresses with the <a href="https://github.com/iancoleman/bip39" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ian Coleman's BIP39 tool</a>, that is already available in Anu₿itux without the need to connect to the Internet.</li>
</ul>
<p>The last solution could be a good one if we are using this procedure to arrange a safe cold storage for our coins. To do it, we can start the Ian Coleman's tool from the WalletTools menu in Anu₿itux, and paste our mnemonic seed in the corresponding box.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/Selection_052.png" alt="iancoleman1" width="1000" height="369" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_052-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_052-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_052-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_052-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_052-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_052-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Then we only have to choose the coin of which we want to have private keys and addresses and, scrolling down the page, we will find all that we need to prepare our cold storage.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/Selection_053.png" alt="iancoleman2" width="1000" height="288" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_053-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_053-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_053-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_053-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_053-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_053-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Now we can choose one or more addresses, with the related private key, and prepare a paper wallet to store in a safe place. If we also want to generate QR codes for our paper wallet, we can use the <a href="https://github.com/fukuchi/libqrencode/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">qrencode</a> tool:</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/Selection_054.png" alt="qrencode" width="800" height="302" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_054-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_054-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_054-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_054-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_054-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/38/responsive/Selection_054-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Of course, if we are intended to use the generated addresses only to receive coins and store them in a safe place, it might be enough to take note only of the public addresses. If in the future we will need to spend our coins, we could do that in a BIP39 compatible wallet.</p>
<p>We could also use the Ian Coleman's tool to obtain addresses of many different coins from the same mnemonic seed.</p>
<p>We should also be able to print our paper wallets without the need to connect to the Internet, exposing our working environment, since Anu₿itux has a lot of printer drivers already installed.</p>
<h3>Final thoughts</h3>
<p>When generating a mnemonic seed or a paper wallet, no care is enough! These are very sensible operations and doing some mistakes or operating with carelessness could compromise our funds. Cryptocurrencies are great because they let us be our bank, but this also implies that we are responsible for our funds.</p>
<p>We should also pay attention to the tools we use during our process. We should prefer simple and open-source tools, that we could easily inspect to be sure about how they handle our precious information. </p>

                    <p><img src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/game-g07f257a77_1920.jpg" class="type:primaryImage" alt="" /></p>
                <p>For many reasons, it could happen that we do not have access to our complete mnemonic seed. For instance, we could have written it by hand too quickly and now we are not able to read it anymore, or we could have hidden it in many places and we are not able to find part of it, or we have written it on paper and it is not completely readable anymore, etc.</p>
<p>With Anu₿itux we can try to solve this issue with <a href="https://github.com/gurnec/btcrecover/blob/master/docs/Seedrecover_Quick_Start_Guide.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seedrecover.py</a>, a tool that comes with <a href="https://btcrecover.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">btcrecover.py</a>. To start it we only need to type seedrecover.py in our Terminal. It has a very simple to use graphical user interface and we only need to answer the prompted question and skip the unavailable information.</p>
<p>Let's check out how it works in a couple of use cases. For the examples we are going to use the following seed, obtained with the <a href="https://iancoleman.io/bip39/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ian Coleman's BIP39 tool</a>.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_007.png" alt="seed" width="800" height="499" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_007-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_007-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_007-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_007-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_007-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_007-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<h3>Case 1: missing words</h3>
<p>Let's hypothesize that we have only the first ten words of our seed:</p>
<p><code>rigid cool hire tiny kingdom inner evidence brown fee airport</code></p>
<p>First of all let's start our tool.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_008.png" alt="" width="700" height="688" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_008-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_008-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_008-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_008-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_008-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_008-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>The tool asks us if we have a wallet file related to our mnemonic seed, but this is not our case so let's skip this question by clicking on the "Cancel" button.</p>
<p>Now we need to choose the kind of wallet we are going to recover, in our case a Bitcoin wallet with BIP39-based words.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_009.png" alt="" width="700" height="721" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_009-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_009-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_009-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_009-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_009-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_009-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>The tool only supports BIP44-derived addresses. This information will be used further by the tool because it will check if the seed is correct by comparing many derived addresses with the one we have to provide. If our seed has been used with a multicurrency wallet like Exodus or Coinomi, we can choose a coin from which we know at least one public address derived from the seed we are trying to recover.</p>
<p>In the next step, the tool is going to ask us if we know a master key of our wallet, but this is not our case, so let's skip this step by clicking on the "Cancel" button.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_010.png" alt="" width="800" height="140" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_010-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_010-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_010-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_010-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_010-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_010-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Now we can provide at least one address derived from our mnemonic seed.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_014.png" alt="" width="1000" height="626" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_014-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_014-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_014-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_014-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_014-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_014-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>It is important to provide addresses obtained with a BIP44 derivation path. This path is commonly used by all the currency but coins like Bitcoin, Litecoin, etc, also support other derivation paths like BIP49 and BIP84.</p>
<p>Now the tool asks us to decide how many addresses we want to be checked for each possible mnemonic seed. If we know the address we have provided is one of the firsts derived, we can provide a low number like 10. Unless so, the tool could take longer to check a lot of possible mnemonic seeds.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_015.png" alt="" width="350" height="181" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_015-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_015-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_015-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_015-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_015-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_015-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Finally, we have to provide the part of the mnemonic seed we have available.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_016.png" alt="" width="350" height="139" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_016-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_016-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_016-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_016-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_016-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_016-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Now we can click on the "OK" button and wait until the tool tries to find the correct mnemonic seed.</p>

<h3>Case 2: wrong words</h3>
<p>Let's now hypothesize we have all the 12 words of our mnemonic seed but for some reason, we are not able to read one of them. So, instead of having the seed</p>
<p><code>rigid cool hire tiny kingdom inner evidence brown fee airport grant orient</code></p>
<p>we have</p>
<p><code>rigid cool hive tiny kingdom inner evidence brown fee airport grant orient</code></p>
<p>In this case, we can follow the same steps we have seed above and, when the tool asks us to enter the best guess for our mnemonic seed, we can insert this sequence of words.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/Selection_041.png" alt="" width="380" height="149" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/Selection_041-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/Selection_041-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/Selection_041-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/Selection_041-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/Selection_041-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/Selection_041-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>In this case, in a few seconds, the tool is able to provide us the correct mnemonic seed!</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/Selection_043.png" alt="" width="900" height="461" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/Selection_043-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/Selection_043-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/Selection_043-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/Selection_043-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/Selection_043-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/10/responsive/Selection_043-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<h3>Final thoughts</h3>
<p>We have seen some simple applications of this tool but, of course, it could also perform harder tasks. For example, it could fix a mnemonic seed with both missing and wrong words. It is important that we do not know only the mnemonic seed we are trying to fix but also at least one other piece of information like our extended public key, one or more addresses or the wallet file the seed is related to. We also need to know the correct derivation path used with the mnemonic seed.</p>

                <p>Usually, when we create a new wallet with <a href="https://electrum.org/#home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Electrum</a>, we obtain a 12 words seed and there is no way to customize it. We can only extend it with an optional passphrase.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/37/Selection_037.png" alt="" width="600" height="429" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/37/responsive/Selection_037-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/37/responsive/Selection_037-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/37/responsive/Selection_037-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/37/responsive/Selection_037-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/37/responsive/Selection_037-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/37/responsive/Selection_037-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>But there is a way to create longer mnemonic seeds using Electrum's derivation algorithm, without the need to generate BIP39 mnemonic seeds with other tools.</p>
<p>We simply need to use our terminal. In Anu₿itux we will use the following command:</p>
<p><code>./Tools/Wallets/electrum-4.3.1-x86_64.AppImage --offline make_seed --nbits=256</code></p>
<p>This command forces Electrum to generate a mnemonic seed using 256 bits of entropy and gives us a phrase that we can import through Elecrtum's user interface.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/37/Selection_038.png" alt="" width="600" height="84" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/37/responsive/Selection_038-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/37/responsive/Selection_038-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/37/responsive/Selection_038-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/37/responsive/Selection_038-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/37/responsive/Selection_038-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/37/responsive/Selection_038-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Now we can start our Electrum wallet with its user interface and create a new wallet importing this mnemonic seed.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/37/Selection_036.png" alt="" width="600" height="439" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/37/responsive/Selection_036-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/37/responsive/Selection_036-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/37/responsive/Selection_036-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/37/responsive/Selection_036-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/37/responsive/Selection_036-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/37/responsive/Selection_036-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>As we can see, the mnemonic seed is valid. If not so, the "Next" button would not be active and we would not be able to complete the wallet creation process.</p>
<p>If we try to examine the mnemonic seed with <a href="https://iancoleman.io/bip39/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ian Coleman's BIP39 tool</a>, we will see that it is not valid since it was not derived from a BIP39 wordlist and does not respect the BIP39 checksum.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/37/Selection_039.png" alt="" width="800" height="335" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/37/responsive/Selection_039-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/37/responsive/Selection_039-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/37/responsive/Selection_039-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/37/responsive/Selection_039-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/37/responsive/Selection_039-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/37/responsive/Selection_039-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>So we have a confirmation that this command gives us the ability to generate 24 words mnemonic seeds with Electrum.</p>

                    <p><img src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/12/key-gf82317512_1920.jpg" class="type:primaryImage" alt="" /></p>
                <p>Using encrypted volumes to store sensitive information is a very good idea. With tools like <a href="https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Home.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Veracrypt</a>, we can encrypt storage devices or create encrypted containers to store all kinds of files in them and make sure that no one will be able to access them without knowing the correct credentials.</p>
<p>Tools like Veracrypt use very strong encryption algorithms so, it is very hard to access files without decrypting them with the correct password and/or the additional credentials set up when we created the volume.</p>
<p>It could happen that, if we did not access a volume for a while, we have no clue about what's the correct password to unlock it.</p>
<p>If we are in doubt between a reasonable number of passwords, we can try to unlock our volume with VeraDecrypt, a tool developed by the Anu₿itux team and included in the Anu₿itux menu under the Recovery section.</p>
<p>To run it simply run it with root privileges (needed by Veracrypt), specifying the volume to unlock with the -v option and the list of passwords to try with the -p option:</p>
<p><code>sudo VeraDecrypt.py -v path/to/volume -p path/to/passwordlist</code></p>
<p>We can use it with encrypted volume files or with encrypted external storages, specifying the path like</p>
<p><code>/dev/sdb1</code></p>
<p>To know the correct name of the external storage we want to try to unlock, we can use the command</p>
<p><code>sudo fdisk -l</code></p>
<h3>Let's see how it works</h3>
<p>First of all let's run the tool and provide the root password, which is set to anubitux.</p>
<p>Since the tool will mount the volume on slot 1 if the correct password is found, before proceeding it warns us and asks for confirmation.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/12/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_019.png" alt="" width="700" height="268" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/12/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_019-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/12/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_019-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/12/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_019-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/12/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_019-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/12/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_019-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/12/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_019-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>If we have a volume mounted on slot 1 it is recommendable to stop the tool typing n, save all the files stored in the already mounted volume we are working on and dismount the volume.</p>
<p>If we have no volumes mounted on slot 1, let's continue by typing y.</p>
<p>Now the tool will try all the passwords that are in the provided list, stopping and warning us if the correct one is found.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/12/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_020.png" alt="" width="700" height="425" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/12/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_020-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/12/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_020-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/12/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_020-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/12/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_020-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/12/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_020-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/12/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_020-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>As we can see, the tool found the correct password. We can now proceed with running Veracrypt and mounting our volume. Veracrypt can be found in Anu₿itux under the Encryption menu.</p>
<p>Some passwords may contain symbols that could cause issues with terminal commands. These will be collected and provided when the tool ends its work so that we can try them manually.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/12/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_021.png" alt="" width="700" height="489" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/12/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_021-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/12/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_021-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/12/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_021-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/12/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_021-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/12/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_021-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/12/responsive/AnuBiBlog_1_6-VMware-Workstation_021-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<h3>Final thoughts</h3>
<p>Of course, there are more efficient methods to try to unlock Veracrypt volumes, like <a href="https://hashcat.net/hashcat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hashcat</a> or other similar tools but sometimes they can be hard to set up and should preferably be run by experienced users. If we need a quick and easy tool that tries a bunch of passwords for us, VeraDecrypt could be the right choice for us.</p>

                <p class="has-drop-cap">When dealing with virtual currencies such as Bitcoin, we know that it is possible to obtain the details of every single transaction. However, it remains extremely complicated to solve another big question regarding virtual currencies: who is hiding behind any address?</p>
<p>There are many services, such as <a href="https://www.walletexplorer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">walletexplorer.com</a> or <a href="https://oxt.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">oxt.me</a> that can:</p>
<ul>
<li>associate an address with others as they are part of the same wallet based on their use (aka <em>clustering</em>);</li>
<li>provide information on the entity that owns the reconstructed wallet (aka <em>tagging</em>).</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to free access online services, such as those mentioned, there are companies specializing in blockchain intelligence. In addition to providing valuable tools that make analysis and investigations easier, they use complex heuristics for clustering and tagging cryptocurrency wallets.</p>
<h3>How can we investigate the blockchain?</h3>
<p>Regarding the clustering techniques, we talked about them in <a href="https://anubitux.org/clustering-bitcoin-addresses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this post</a>.</p>
<p>Suffice it to say that, knowing in depth aspects of Bitcoin such as the format of the addresses and the management of the amounts to be transferred, it is possible to deduce that multiple addresses are associated with the same entity.</p>
<p>Using clustering techniques and starting from an address whose entity that manages it is known, it will be possible to associate the whole reconstructed cluster with it.</p>
<h3>How does <em>clustering</em> work</h3>
<p>Let’s take a look at the following <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/en/btc/tx/ff51e4b5dddb4425a34a442710855d36376126313ad89417c004acab85705d4c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transaction</a>:</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/34/1.png" alt="" width="600" height="76" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/34/responsive/1-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/34/responsive/1-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/34/responsive/1-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/34/responsive/1-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/34/responsive/1-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/34/responsive/1-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<div>
<p>If we are aware that the address <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/en/btc/address/1KKJ992kekD8KHMhGVLmkGodBPzVaoky88" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1KKJ992kekD8KHMhGVLmkGodBPzVaoky88</a> belongs to entity A, we can say that also the other sender address belongs to the same entity A. This clustering method is called “co-spending”. It is based on the assumption that to spend the bitcoins of multiple addresses it is necessary to sign the transaction with the private key of each of these. Therefore, whoever arranges the transaction must simultaneously have all the private keys available and it is unreasonable to think that these are in the availability of foreign subjects.</p>
<p>Knowing the Bitcoin protocol better, especially considering that:</p>
<ul>
<li>transactions consist in forwarding amounts previously received and not yet spent;</li>
<li>in transactions, there is generally a change address that receives the part of bitcoin used in the transaction that is not intended to be sent to the recipient and is not intended to be paid as a fee;</li>
<li>transaction fees are generally determined by the clients used on the basis of the byte weight of the transaction;</li>
</ul>
<p>it is possible to associate the cluster also to the address receiving the change of the transaction.</p>
<p>In fact, in this case, if the purpose of the transaction had been to send 0.00682001 bitcoins to the first address, it would not have made sense to use both amounts to weigh down the transaction. So we can say that the address <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/en/btc/address/1GkYDvrGzDCXmnx8P9VTKByWSnrzNfzGQL" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1GkYDvrGzDCXmnx8P9VTKByWSnrzNfzGQL</a> also belongs to entity A, since it received the change of the transaction.</p>
<h3>What about tagging?</h3>
<p>Once we understand how to associate multiple addresses with each other, we need to understand how to link them to a known entity. In addition to using the aforementioned services, we can think of searching online for each address of the cluster using various services such as <a href="https://bitcoinwhoswho.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BitcoinWhosWho</a> or by searching on portals such as <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BitcoinTalk</a> or <a href="https://keybase.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Keybase</a>.</p>
<p>It may happen that these methods give positive results, but often this is not the case. And if you are dealing with entities that are particularly attentive to anonymity such as black markets, it will be even more difficult to find information online. The difficulty increases with the markets created most recently. In fact, it is not unusual to find a lot of information on wallets from past markets, such as <a href="https://oxt.me/entity/silk%20road" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silk Road</a> or <a href="https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/AlphaBayMarket" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alphabay</a>, while for more recent markets, information is scarce.</p>
<p>To be able to find something useful you can try to stir things up a bit, using a so-called “dust transaction”.</p>
<h3>Dust transactions</h3>
<p>These transactions take the form of sending very small amounts of bitcoins to a large number of addresses. Below you can see an <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/en/btc/tx/e2d7a80680aa366acfe1cbd0fa8deb1bbb0dd11e62678208aa01c0533d114937" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">example</a>:</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/34/2.png" alt="" width="600" height="167" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/34/responsive/2-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/34/responsive/2-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/34/responsive/2-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/34/responsive/2-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/34/responsive/2-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/34/responsive/2-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>The transaction features over 2700 destination addresses and an amount spent that does not even reach 0.03 bitcoins. If, when the transaction is prepared, the ownership of each address is noted, it will be possible, studying its future activity, to reconnect it to other addresses and perhaps reconstruct at least part of the wallet of the subject we are examining.</p>
<p>Basically, with a dust transaction, we are creating a starting point for an analysis aimed at the reconstruction of a wallet of interest.</p>
<p>Such an analysis makes sense if the transaction is directed to addresses that would otherwise not be used or disclosed. Otherwise, if we are dealing with addresses already in use, mere monitoring would be more than enough. Instead, let’s think of services that automatically provide a new address every time they request payments in bitcoin. The addresses generated will still be in the availability of the service, but if they do not receive transactions they will not be used and no further analysis will be possible.</p>
<h3>A practical case: black markets</h3>
<p>An analysis of this type may well be applied to a black market, especially those that have an escrow wallet. In practice, those markets keep the balance of each user and reduce it as they make purchases.</p>
<p>Let’s register a test account on such a market, for example, <a href="https://www.darknetstats.com/big-blue-market/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BigBlueMarket</a> (now offline) and let’s try to top up our available balance.</p>
<p>From the main page, we see that the balance of the newly created account is zero and that we can click on the appropriate link “deposit funds”.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/34/3.png" alt="" width="600" height="235" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/34/responsive/3-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/34/responsive/3-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/34/responsive/3-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/34/responsive/3-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/34/responsive/3-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/34/responsive/3-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>In this way we will see a new screen, where there is an address associated with our account and towards which we can arrange a transaction. By doing so we will have funds available to make purchases on the market.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/34/4.png" alt="" width="600" height="294" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/34/responsive/4-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/34/responsive/4-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/34/responsive/4-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/34/responsive/4-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/34/responsive/4-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/34/responsive/4-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>We got the address 19t8ESJ6iMWbBMNT1qS5nnHxZT2ijQhWww. By sending bitcoins to it, our balance will automatically be increased. We have to consider that the address is not in our availability, but is managed by the market administrators. As we make purchases, there will be no corresponding transactions starting from the identified address, but only an update of a record in the market’s database. The address will always remain in the exclusive availability of the market administrators. In addition, if there was a direct transaction to the seller’s wallet, this could seriously compromise their anonymity and dissuade them from selling on that particular market. Therefore, to maximize the anonymity of users registered on the platform, it is reasonable that the individual trades are managed off-chain by the market.</p>
<h3>The advantages of “dust transactions”</h3>
<p>The activity of the Bitcoin addresses used to top up accounts will not follow a trend that will reflect the actual activity performed on the market. Therefore, it is more than reasonable to think that at some point the administrators will also use the bitcoins of the address we have (hypothetically) reloaded for various reasons.</p>
<p>If instead of reloading a single address, we send a very small amount of bitcoins to different addresses, it will be very likely that some of these will be used together with other addresses in the market. Thus, little by little, it will be possible to at least partially reconstruct the wallet used by the administrators that manage the market.</p>
<p>In doing so, we have created various starting points to rediscover the black market's wallet. As soon as the administrators move the funds either for a withdrawal requested by a seller or to withdraw their earnings, they will most likely also use some of the bitcoins present on the addresses we know. By doing so, using this address together with others in a single transaction, we will be able to reconstruct the market wallet a little at a time.</p>
<p>Holders of the wallet could make a “coin selection” before arranging the transactions and notice the presence of dust transactions, avoiding spending them and compromising their anonymity. However, by carrying out similar transactions to a large number of addresses, relating to different entities of interest, with a negligible expense it could be possible to reconstruct and tag a large number of wallets.</p>
<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>Dust transactions are one of the methods used to try to find information on cryptocurrency wallets. Clearly, it is a method with several contraindications. In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>it is better to use it only when there are no other viable roads;</li>
<li>it requires a cost as, albeit small, a Bitcoin transaction must be arranged;</li>
<li>the target of the investigation could notice the dust transaction and become aware of our interest;</li>
<li>sending a transaction to the target must be done with due caution so as not to reveal information about us and obtain the opposite effect to that hoped for.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, if used with due care, dust transactions can sometimes give a turning point to investigations that cannot otherwise be resolved, in particular with limited resources or little time available.</p>

                <p class="msg msg--success"><em>This post has to be considered educational and is intended to show how mnemonic seeds work, how to manage private keys and what considerations to make when disposing a transac</em><em>tion. Always be careful when managing seeds, especially with devices connected to the Internet.</em></p>
<p>Many wallet clients do not allow users to see the private keys of their addresses, which could be useful, for example, to spend coins only from the desired address. Even if the addresses are derived from the same seed, they are not bound together and, from the outside, each address is an autonomous entity with its private key. Maybe we used addresses to receive funds from different sources and spending these together could compromise our privacy or correlate funds that we want to keep separate. Indeed, as seen in <a href="https://anubitux.org/clustering-bitcoin-addresses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this post</a>, it is very simple to correlate addresses spending funds in the same transaction.</p>
<h3>How to solve this?</h3>
<p>Private keys are rarely revealed by our clients, especially if we are using hardware wallets but usually we have access to the mnemonic seed phrase, that is needed to restore access to a wallet. Through a hierarchical-deterministic process, private keys, public keys and public addresses are derived from this sequence of words, but we usually see only our addresses.</p>
<h3>How could we do that?</h3>
<p>Let's see an example procedure, carried out with Anu₿itux, to obtain the private key of a specific address, minimizing the risks of handling our mnemonic seed thanks to the fact that we are using a live working environment.</p>
<p>For example, let's say we are interested in the private key of a specific address that we usually manage with our <a href="https://blockstream.com/green/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blockstream Green Wallet</a>, like the following one.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/Selection_028.png" alt="green1" width="800" height="360" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/Selection_028-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/Selection_028-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/Selection_028-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/Selection_028-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/Selection_028-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/Selection_028-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>To know the related private key we also need to know our mnemonic seed, in this case: <em>stand tree close slice beauty alert stereo green beauty verify fatal since brown pig impact zone snap measure obtain fun often neither rough elevator.</em></p>
<p class="msg msg--warning"><em><strong>Handling our mnemonic seeds has always to be considered a very dangerous operation. We should only do that in safe places, preferably alone, and store it in a safe place when it is not needed anymore.</strong></em></p>
<p>To derive all the information from this seed, we can use the <a href="https://iancoleman.io/bip39/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ian Coleman's tool</a>, integrated into Anu₿itux in the "WalletTools" menu.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_001.png" alt="" width="550" height="664" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_001-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_001-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_001-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_001-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_001-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_001-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Before starting the tool, it is recommended to safeguard our security by putting the operating system offline. To do that, we can click on the proper desktop shortcut and provide the root password, which is set to anubitux.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_002.png" alt="" width="300" height="362" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_002-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_002-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_002-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_002-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_002-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_002-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Now we can start the tool and type the seed in the proper box. The tool will automatically derive the desired information (the "Auto compute" box must be checked).</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/Selection_017.png" alt="Bip39_paste" width="800" height="360" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/Selection_017-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/Selection_017-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/Selection_017-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/Selection_017-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/Selection_017-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/Selection_017-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Scrolling down the page, we can see all the derived addresses. By default, the tool derives Bitcoin legacy addresses (those starting with 1). In this case, we are interested in bech32 Bitcoin addresses, derived with the BIP84 derivation path. To see them we have to click on the proper button.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/Selection_018.png" alt="bip_selection" width="500" height="342" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/Selection_018-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/Selection_018-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/Selection_018-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/Selection_018-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/Selection_018-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/Selection_018-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Continuing to scroll the page, we will find all the bech32 addresses derived from our mnemonic seed, with the related public and private keys.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/Selection_019.png" alt="addresses" width="1000" height="297" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/Selection_019-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/Selection_019-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/Selection_019-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/Selection_019-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/Selection_019-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/Selection_019-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Now we can store the desired private key in a text file and close our browser. The browser in Anu₿itux has been set up to lose all the information when it is closed, so we do not need to reboot the system to be safe and we do not have to store the private key on an external memorization device.</p>
<p>At this point we can import the private key in Electrum, using the procedure shown in <a href="https://anubitux.org/how-to-spend-a-paper-wallet-with-anubitux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this tutorial</a>. It is important to specify the correct format of the private key when importing it, in this case typing "p2wpkh:" before the key.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_003.png" alt="importkey" width="600" height="436" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_003-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_003-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_003-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_003-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_003-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_003-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Finally, we have control of our address through the Electrum client and we could spend the available coins as we want.</p>

<p>We need to remember to turn our working environment online, through the proper desktop shortcut, to be able to see the addresse's balance and send transactions to the Bitcoin network.</p>
<h3><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_005.png" alt="goOnline" width="230" height="356" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_005-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_005-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_005-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_005-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_005-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_005-2xl.png 1600w"></figure></h3>
<p>This procedure can be used also to obtain private keys of addresses related to other cryptocurrencies, like Ethereum. After providing the seeds, we only need to choose the desired coin from the proper menu.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/Selection_023.png" alt="coinselect" width="800" height="265" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/Selection_023-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/Selection_023-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/Selection_023-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/Selection_023-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/Selection_023-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/Selection_023-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Now, at the bottom of the page, there will be the addresses and the private keys derived starting from the same seed, but with the derivation path related to another coin.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/Selection_024.png" alt="derivedETH" width="1000" height="368" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/Selection_024-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/Selection_024-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/Selection_024-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/Selection_024-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/Selection_024-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/Selection_024-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<h3>Another way </h3>
<p>The same result could have been obtained by importing the seed into Electrum.</p>
<p>First of all, we need to import the seed in Electrum. When typing it we have to click on the "Option" button and select the "BIP39 seed" option.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_007.png" alt="bip39elc" width="600" height="441" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_007-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_007-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_007-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_007-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_007-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_007-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Now we have to specify the derivation path we want Electrum to use to derive our addresses, in our case "native segwit" corresponding to BIP84 (m/84'/0'/0').</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_009.png" alt="derpathelec" width="600" height="426" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_009-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_009-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_009-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_009-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_009-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_009-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Now we can see that we have many Bitcoin addresses available, including the one of which we want to find the private key.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_010.png" alt="elecaddr" width="800" height="422" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_010-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_010-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_010-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_010-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_010-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_010-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>To obtain the private key of the desired address and also of all the other derived addresses, we have to click on the "Wallet" menu, then on "Private Keys" and on "Export".</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_006.png" alt="privkeyexport" width="800" height="418" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_006-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_006-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_006-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_006-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_006-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_006-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>After providing the wallet's password, that we have set up when we imported the seed, we will obtain all the private keys. We can also export the list to a CSV or a JSON file.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_007-2.png" alt="privkeylist" width="800" height="392" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_007-2-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_007-2-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_007-2-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_007-2-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_007-2-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/AnuBitux_2022_1_4_VM-Running-Oracle-VM-VirtualBox_007-2-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<h3>Final thoughts</h3>
<p>The shown procedure should be used only to test how mnemonic seeds and private keys or for specific purposes, like spending coins only from the desired address when using clients that do not support "coin selection" features.</p>
<p>Before using this procedure for real needs, it is recommended to do an online search about our client, checking if it allows us to see the private keys of our address with some kind of hidden menu. In this way, we will not need to access our backup seed and leave it safe in the place we have chosen to store it.</p>
<p class="msg msg--warning"><em>In any case, these procedures are intended to be used with wallets used as "hot wallets". It is not recommended to manage seeds related to cold storage in that way unless we are intended to move all the funds.</em></p>

                <p class="msg msg--warning"><em><strong>DISCLAIMER</strong>: This post contains some suggestions that could be helpful for law enforcement agencies or security consultants that need to seize cryptocurrencies. It aims to show how Anu₿itux could be used to perform the seizure but is not intended to be exhaustive. It is also recommended to check the local law before proceeding with a cryptocurrency seizure procedure.</em></p>
<p>Anu₿itux is realized to safeguard users' privacy and provide a very simple environment to manage a lot of aspects regarding cryptos. Of course, it could be used by law enforcement agencies and security consultants to perform crypto seizures.</p>
<h3>Where?</h3>
<p>Doing a crypto seizure, the first matter is to obtain a secure place to store cryptocurrencies With Anu₿itux we can create a lot of different kinds of wallets to store coins. One of the best and cheaper ways is to store them with a <a href="https://anubitux.org/how-to-generate-random-paper-wallets-with-anubitux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">paper wallet</a>. In previous posts, we have seen some methods to realize <a href="https://anubitux.org/how-to-create-a-paper-wallet-with-anubitux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bitcoin</a> and <a href="https://anubitux.org/how-to-create-a-monero-paper-wallet-with-anubitux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monero</a> paper wallets, but these procedures can be adapted also to other currencies. With Anu₿itux we also can print our paper wallets without the need to connect to the Internet and download drivers, since it has a lot of them already installed. </p>
<p>Once we printed our paper wallet, we also need to take care of where are we going to store it. We should use a sealed container that does not reveal any information, even if exposing it near a strong light or wetting it. We also need to close it in a way that makes it difficult to open and that can reveal if someone accessed it without authorization.</p>
<p>If we had time to prepare the seizure we could have a hardware wallet to store the currencies we need to size. In this case, we can also use Anu₿itux to manage it, because it integrates clients, drivers and udev rules for many different <a href="https://anubitux.org/connecting-your-hardware-wallet-to-anubitux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hardware wallets</a>, like Ledgers, Trezors, Bitboxes, etc. In this case, it is very important to decide how to handle the mnemonic seed because, even if hardware wallets can be considered very secure, obtaining their seed could give complete control over the handled funds. If we decide to keep the seed, we can consider valid the same considerations we made for paper wallets.</p>
<p>If we need to perform a Bitcoin seizure, a good way to store the seized coins could be to use an <a href="https://opendime.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenDime</a>. It is a special kind of hardware wallet, supporting only Bitcoin, that gives us a public address to send the coins to and that won't reveal the related private key unless we push a pin through the appropriate hole. So, as long as this hole is safe, we can be sure that no human has seen the private key of our address and no one could have spent the funds we sent to the OpenDime's public address.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/17/Selection_027.png" alt="opendime" width="600" height="317" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/17/responsive/Selection_027-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/17/responsive/Selection_027-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/17/responsive/Selection_027-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/17/responsive/Selection_027-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/17/responsive/Selection_027-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/17/responsive/Selection_027-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<h3>How?</h3>
<p>Once we have arranged something to send the coins to, we need to dispose a transaction to accomplish the seizure. We need to remember that the only way for a seizure to be effective is to have the funds on something that is under our control. So we need to be sure that there are no other copies of the wallet that is going to keep the seized coins and that there is a way to guarantee that no one can have access to private keys or seeds. So, we can't consider the funds as seized if we seize a hardware wallet, a device with some kind of wallet installed, or a recovery seed. All these things could have been backed up in a lot of creative ways so, if we don't move funds they could be accessed in many ways and our seizure could be ineffective.</p>
<p>Moving funds could not be that easy. There are many ways to protect cryptocurrencies from unauthorized uses, like PINs, passwords, passphrases, etc. If the owner of the funds we need to seize is cooperating, we should not encounter any problem disposing the transaction. If not so, we could need to take control of the funds against their will.</p>
<p>With skilled users, it could be almost impossible, but a lot of users are lazy or do not have a very strong OpSec. So we could do some of the following actions, looking for any information that could be used to take control over the funds:</p>
<ul>
<li>try to unlock wallet files with <a href="https://anubitux.org/recover-access-to-a-wallet-file-with-anubitux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">btcrecover</a>, maybe using a custom password list created with credentials extracted from the users' browsers or from their devices or based on their personal information;</li>
<li>scan directories for mnemonic seeds with <a href="https://anubitux.org/search-for-bip39-seeds-with-anubitux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seedsearch</a>;</li>
<li>scan directories for private keys with <a href="https://anubitux.org/how-to-find-lost-private-keys-with-anubitux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">btckeysearch</a>;</li>
<li>try to unlock encrypted volumes and containers with <a href="https://github.com/ASeriousMister/VeraDecrypt.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">veradecrypt</a>, maybe using a custom password list created with credentials extracted from the users' browsers or from their devices or based on their personal information;</li>
<li>perform an accurate house search looking for everything that seems like a mnemonic seed or a private key or any kind of wallet stuff;</li>
<li>any other creative idea is welcome.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once we obtained the information we need to dispose the transaction, we need to know how to use it. If we have found the password or the PIN to unlock a desktop wallet, we can dispose the transaction from there or we could decide to <a href="https://anubitux.org/how-to-sign-a-transaction-offline-with-anubitux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dispose it offline</a> to avoid using the user's device. Instead, if we have found mnemonic seeds or private keys, we need to import them to a compatible client. If we don't know how the seeds were used, we can use <a href="https://anubitux.org/find-out-how-a-seed-was-used-with-anubitux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seedcheck</a> and try to find it out and import it to the right client. Instead, if we have found some <a href="https://anubitux.org/how-to-find-lost-private-keys-with-anubitux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">private keys</a>, we can refer to the procedures shown for <a href="https://anubitux.org/how-to-spend-a-paper-wallet-with-anubitux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bitcoin</a> and <a href="https://anubitux.org/how-to-spend-a-monero-paper-wallet-with-anubitux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monero</a>.</p>
<h3>Considerations</h3>
<p>There are a lot of considerations that can be done when performing this kind of procedure and, as much experience we have, as many useful considerations we will be able to make.</p>
<p>One of the first considerations we need to make is about the network fees. A higher one could be useful to obtain faster confirmations of our transaction and consider it valid but, if the chosen fee is too high, it could impact too much on the seized amount.</p>
<p>When the transaction has been disposed, we also need to wait for some confirmations to avoid that someone else could make it invalid with an <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Replace_by_fee" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RBF</a> (replace by fee) transaction, that is a transaction with a higher fee that could be processed faster and making ours look like a "double spend" attempt.</p>
<p>Other useful considerations could be done when dealing with multi-currency wallets, like <a href="https://www.exodus.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exodus</a>, <a href="https://www.coinomi.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coinomi</a>, <a href="https://wallet.mycelium.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MyCellium</a>, <a href="https://guarda.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Guarda</a>, <a href="https://atomicwallet.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Atomic</a>, etc. First of all, it could be better to arrange a paper wallet for any of the available currencies. We also need to evaluate if the user owns tokens in his wallet that work on layer 2 blockchains, like <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ERC20</a> tokens, <a href="https://opensea.io/blog/guides/non-fungible-tokens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NFTs</a>, etc. These tokens "live" on other blockchains and do not have their own so, to move them, we need to pay the fee with the main coin related to the blockchain on which they work. For instance, with tokens like <a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BAT</a> or <a href="https://shibatoken.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shiba Inu</a>, we won't be able to move them without an amount of ETH that we will need to pay gas fees for the Ethereum network. This happens not only with tokens working on the Ethereum network but also with tokens working on networks like <a href="https://solscan.io/tokens" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Solana</a>, <a href="https://bscscan.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BSC</a>, etc.</p>
<h3>Final thoughts</h3>
<p>What we have seen in this post is just a collection of tips that can be useful for those who need to seize cryptocurrencies. Of course, it is a more complex operation that needs a lot of different skills, not only regarding how cryptocurrencies work but also regarding digital forensic techniques, networking, OpSec, etc.</p>
<p>In this scenario, Anu₿itux tries to provide a simple and safe environment that includes all the tools that could be helpful when performing such tasks.</p>
