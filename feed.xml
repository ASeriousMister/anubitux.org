<p><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US">Without pretending to be able to </span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US"><i>liquidate</i></span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US"> the subject of cryptography in such small spaces, since such a vast and complex subject certainly goes beyond the purpose of these articles, I leave ample space for the passion and study of each of us on texts also available online.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US">This concluding article wants us to get to know a little better how a cryptographic method that is very popular and discussed today works: the use of Elliptic-Curve Cryptography in the Bitcoin protocol.</span></span></span></p>
<h4>Some preliminary information</h4>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US">If we wanted to use a similarity with the traditional credit system, we could think, simplifying to a minimum, that in the Bitcoin system the </span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US"><strong>public address</strong></span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US"> represents a sort of Iban code, the </span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US"><strong>wallet</strong></span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US"> is the credit institution or a safety deposit box and the </span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US"><strong>private address</strong></span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US"> depicts the secret code to access the account or the key used to open the safety deposit box.<br>Choosing a wallet is one of the first operations to be carried out to enter the world of cryptocurrencies and is equivalent to opening a virtual wallet, which acts as a container for one's bitcoin addresses.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US">There are various types of wallets, each with its advantages and disadvantages, depending on whether you want to use it on a computer, smartphone or directly online, in the latter case without installing any program. This first category is known in the jargon as </span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US"><i>hot wallets</i></span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US">, because it is based on applications that are somehow connected to the internet.<br>Conversely, </span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US"><i>cold wallets</i></span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US"> or </span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US"><i>cold storages</i></span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US"> are considered much more secure since they are not connected to the internet. This category includes wallets stored on an external mass memory and kept in a safe place, or the so-called </span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US"><i>hardware wallets</i></span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US">, hardware devices created specifically to store private addresses.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US">Among the cold wallets we can certainly mention the </span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US"><i>physical bitcoins</i></span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US">, real coins minted in metals of different values, inside which the numerical representation of the private bitcoin address is printed and kept.<br>Finally, one of the methods considered among the safest for storing bitcoin addresses is the </span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US"><i>paper wallet</i></span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US">, i.e. the simple printing of bitcoin addresses on paper, perhaps even in QR Code format to facilitate their use, to be kept in a safe place.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US">Although the cold wallet category is generally considered more secure, since it is not exposed to any pitfalls deriving from connection to a network, it must be borne in mind that the loss of one of the aforementioned devices results in the almost certain loss of the bitcoins contained in them.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US">All these applications and devices have, as their main purpose, the preservation of bitcoin addresses, in particular the private one on which the existence of both the public address and the bitcoins themselves depend.</span></span></span></p>
<h4>The Bitcoin protocol</h4>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US">We all know by now that the Bitcoin system is based on the invention of what we can define as the </span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US"><i>backbone</i></span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US"> of this protocol, which is the </span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US"><strong>Blockchain</strong></span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US">.<br>Beyond what the use (and abuse, I would add) of this excellent intuition has become today, it will be necessary to remember that </span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US"><u>for the Bitcoin system to guarantee secure transactions between users, without the presence of intermediaries who act as guarantors, the creators took advantage of the important developments in cryptography</u></span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US">, especially public-key cryptography.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US">In fact, the first approach to the Bitcoin world takes place with the creation of one's own key pair, the public and the private one, linked together through a one-way cryptographic function called the </span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US"><strong>Elliptic Curve Digital</strong></span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US"> </span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US"><strong>Signature Algorithm</strong></span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US"> or </span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US"><strong>ECDSA</strong></span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US">). In particular, the elliptic curve called </span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US"><i><strong>secp256k1 </strong></i></span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US">was chosen (so called according to the classification </span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US"><i>Standards for Efficient Cryptography</i></span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US"> or SEC, "International Consortium for the Development of Commercial Standards for Efficient Cryptography" based on elliptic curve cryptography, more information can be found at page 9 of </span></span></span><a href="http://www.secg.org/sec2-v2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US"><u>this </u></span></span></span></a><u><a href="http://www.secg.org/sec2-v2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">document</a></u><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US">), which guarantees high levels of security and short keys, in order to facilitate its use by users.</span></span></span></p>

<h4>Transactions and privacy</h4>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US">A transaction is basically a passage of bitcoins from one address to another. In order to ensure the highest level of security at all times during this very delicate phase, the Bitcoin system makes extensive use of the cryptographic techniques described in the previous article, such as </span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US"><i>hashing</i></span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US"> and </span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US"><i>digital</i></span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US"> </span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US"><i>signature.</i></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US">Let's see what happens when we want to transfer some bitcoins from one address to another:</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US">When a user A (whom we will call </span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US"><strong>Sender</strong></span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US">) decides to transfer X number of bitcoins to a user B (whom we will call </span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US"><strong>Recipient</strong></span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US">) all he has to do is enter the recipient's bitcoin address and the desired amount of bitcoins in the application used as wallet. The software will automatically take care of carrying out a series of operations not directly visible to users, but which are necessary to make the bitcoins transit with extreme security.<br><br>First of all, it must be stated that, simplifying a lot, </span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US"><u>due to an intrinsic property of the Bitcoin protocol, every time a Sender initiates a transaction, he will use the parts not used in previous transactions (</u></span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US"><i><u>UTxO</u></i></span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US"><u> = unspent transaction output)</u></span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US">. All of these parts, used up to the desired amount, will be sent to the Recipient, any part exceeding the amount due will be considered as remainder.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US">In fact, each transaction can be represented as a register divided between inputs, containing all the previous transactions from which the bitcoins of one's address originate, and the outputs where the addresses of the recipients will be indicated, including that of the sender if not all of their bitcoins are used.<br>The output of one transaction will become the input of the next transaction.<br>Normally the input values ​​are greater than the output ones, since the system is structured to recognize a reward, called </span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US"><i>fee</i></span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US">, to users (so-called </span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US"><strong>miners</strong></span></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US">) who will take care of including this transaction in the Blockchain.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US">Each transaction is made up of addresses, amounts, digital signatures and hash values, as well as other data useful for the correct functioning of the system, but in no case are there names or references to the people who are using these bitcoins.<br>For this reason, the Bitcoin system does not allow a direct relationship between real users and the addresses they use, even if we cannot speak of an anonymous transaction system.<br>Each Bitcoin transaction, after being approved, is published in a register, called Blockchain, which is public and unalterable.<br>This means that for each transaction made, there will be an annotation in this register, always visible and available to anyone who wants to consult it.<br>Furthermore, using additional tools, some of which are freely available online, it is possible to obtain a list of all transactions, as well as other useful information, relating to a specific bitcoin address. On this topic I recommend you to read </span></span></span><a href="https://osintops.com/blockchain-pat-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US"><u>this </u></span></span></span></a><u><a href="https://osintops.com/blockchain-pat-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">excellent</a> article</u><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="en-US">.</span></span></span></p>

                <p>When handling cryptocurrency-related stuff, like private keys, seeds, etc... we often hear things like "256 bits", "128 bits",... but what does it mean?</p>
<p>Computers use their different type of memories to perform any kind of action. The smallest memory unit is called bit and it can assume only 0 and 1 as a value. More bits chained together are able to represent any kind of information that a computer may be able to read.</p>
<p>Indeed, computers are only able to manage numbers, even when we see text and pictures, computers are handling numbers. M<span class="--l --r sentence_highlight"><span class="--l --r hover:bg-[#B4DAE8]">ore</span> <span class="--l --r hover:bg-[#B4DAE8]">in</span> <span class="--l --r hover:bg-[#B4DAE8]">detail</span></span>, computers manage binary numbers, only made by 0s and 1s, like 10001001.</p>
<p>In our tools, like <a href="https://anubitux.org/how-to-generate-a-mnemonic-seed-with-anubitux-and-a-dice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dice2Seed</a> and <a href="https://anubitux.org/how-to-generate-random-paper-wallets-with-anubitux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DiceTracker</a> we have seen that we could also paste a binary string to obtain mnemonic phrases or private keys. But, what are these binary strings?</p>
<h3>How numbers work</h3>
<p>We are used to counting with numbers like 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, ... These are base10 numbers but we could also have base16 numbers, base64 or also base2. The number expresses the number of available digits. With base10 we have 10 digits (from 0 to 9) and with base2 we only have 2 digits (0 and 1).</p>
<p>When counting, each time we reach the maximum value we add another digit on the left and start counting again. So when we are counting and we reach the number 9, we add a 1 on the left and start again from 0, obtaining the number 10; when we reach the number 99, we add a 1 on the left and obtain the number 100, and so on...</p>
<p>Each digit gets a value depending on its position in the number. The first digit is multiplied by 1 (which is the result of 10^0), the second one is multiplied by 10 (which is the result of 10^1), the second one is multiplied by 100 (which is the result of 10^2), and so on.</p>
<p>The same thing happens also with base2 numbers, but in this case, the first digit gets multiplied by 2^0, the second one gets multiplied by 2^1, the third one gets multiplied by 2^2, and so on.</p>
<h3>How to convert binary to decimals</h3>
<p>As seen above, every digit of a binary number assumes a certain value depending on its position. What we basically have to do is to multiply the digit's value (which may be 0 or 1) by 2 elevated to the digit's position. Let's consider the following example:</p>
<table class="align-center" style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;" border="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="width: 12.4822%;">2^7</td>
<td style="width: 12.4822%;">2^6</td>
<td style="width: 12.4822%;">2^5</td>
<td style="width: 12.4822%;">2^4</td>
<td style="width: 12.4822%;">2^3</td>
<td style="width: 12.4822%;">2^2</td>
<td style="width: 12.4822%;">2^1</td>
<td style="width: 12.4822%;">2^0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="width: 12.4822%;">1</td>
<td style="width: 12.4822%;">0</td>
<td style="width: 12.4822%;">0</td>
<td style="width: 12.4822%;">0</td>
<td style="width: 12.4822%;">1</td>
<td style="width: 12.4822%;">0</td>
<td style="width: 12.4822%;">0</td>
<td style="width: 12.4822%;">1</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>To convert the binary number 10001001 into a decimal number, we have to calculate this sum:</p>
<p class="align-center"><code>1*2^0 + 0*2^1 + 0*2^2 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^4 + 0*2^5 + 0*2^6 + 1*2^7</code></p>
<p>which is equal to</p>
<p class="align-center"><code>1*1 + 0 + 0 + 1*8 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1*128 = <strong>137</strong></code></p>
<h3>How to convert decimals to binary</h3>
<p>We could also need to convert a base10 number into a base2 one. This may be a little bit more complex, but let's do that with a simple and practical approach.</p>
<p>We need to consider that in a binary number, every digit has a value that equals 2 times the previous one. So we'll have a sequence like 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, ...</p>
<p>We first need to find the biggest number of that sequence that is not greater than the one that we have to convert into a binary number.</p>
<p>So, let's hypothesize we want to convert 137 into a binary number:</p>
<ul>
<li>is 64 greater than 137? NO, so it may be the first number we are looking for;</li>
<li>is 128 greater than 137? NO, so it may be the first number we are looking for instead of 64;</li>
<li>is 256 greater than 137? YES, so it is not a valid solution and 128 is the first number we are looking for.</li>
</ul>
<p>128 is equal to 2^7 so we can put a 1 in the 8th position (starting from the right) of our binary number (do not forget that computers start counting from 0).</p>
<table class="align-center" style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; height: 100.719px;" border="1">
<tbody>
<tr style="height: 50.3594px;">
<td style="width: 12.4822%; height: 50.3594px;">2^7</td>
<td style="width: 12.4822%; height: 50.3594px;">2^6</td>
<td style="width: 12.4822%; height: 50.3594px;">2^5</td>
<td style="width: 12.4822%; height: 50.3594px;">2^4</td>
<td style="width: 12.4822%; height: 50.3594px;">2^3</td>
<td style="width: 12.4822%; height: 50.3594px;">2^2</td>
<td style="width: 12.4822%; height: 50.3594px;">2^1</td>
<td style="width: 12.4822%; height: 50.3594px;">2^0</td>
</tr>
<tr style="height: 50.3594px;">
<td style="width: 12.4822%; height: 50.3594px;"><strong>1</strong></td>
<td style="width: 12.4822%; height: 50.3594px;">?</td>
<td style="width: 12.4822%; height: 50.3594px;">?</td>
<td style="width: 12.4822%; height: 50.3594px;">?</td>
<td style="width: 12.4822%; height: 50.3594px;">?</td>
<td style="width: 12.4822%; height: 50.3594px;">?</td>
<td style="width: 12.4822%; height: 50.3594px;">?</td>
<td style="width: 12.4822%; height: 50.3594px;">?</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Now we need to find the second digit of our binary number. We can apply the same criteria to the remaining part of the number we are looking for.</p>
<p>The remaining part of the number we are looking for is equal to 137 - 128 = 9. So we need to find the bigger number in the sequence that is not greater than 9. It is very easy to find out that it is 8, which corresponds to the 4th position of our binary number (2^3). The middle ones will be 0s.</p>
<table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;" border="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="width: 12.5535%; height: 50.3594px;">2^7</td>
<td style="width: 12.5535%; height: 50.3594px;">2^6</td>
<td style="width: 12.5535%; height: 50.3594px;">2^5</td>
<td style="width: 12.5535%; height: 50.3594px;">2^4</td>
<td style="width: 12.5535%; height: 50.3594px;">2^3</td>
<td style="width: 12.5535%; height: 50.3594px;">2^2</td>
<td style="width: 12.5535%; height: 50.3594px;">2^1</td>
<td style="width: 12.5535%; height: 50.3594px;">2^0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="width: 12.5535%; height: 50.3594px;"><strong>1</strong></td>
<td style="width: 12.5535%; height: 50.3594px;">0</td>
<td style="width: 12.5535%; height: 50.3594px;">0</td>
<td style="width: 12.5535%; height: 50.3594px;">0</td>
<td style="width: 12.5535%; height: 50.3594px;"><strong>1</strong></td>
<td style="width: 12.5535%; height: 50.3594px;">?</td>
<td style="width: 12.5535%; height: 50.3594px;">?</td>
<td style="width: 12.5535%; height: 50.3594px;">?</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Now we have to find the next digit for the remaining part of the decimal number we are converting, which corresponds to 137 - 128 - 8 = 1. In this case we can easily find out that 1 is equal to the first number of our sequence, so we can place a 1 in the first position of our binary number (corresponding to 2^0).</p>
<table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;" border="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="width: 12.5535%; height: 50.3594px;">2^7</td>
<td style="width: 12.5535%; height: 50.3594px;">2^6</td>
<td style="width: 12.5535%; height: 50.3594px;">2^5</td>
<td style="width: 12.5535%; height: 50.3594px;">2^4</td>
<td style="width: 12.5535%; height: 50.3594px;">2^3</td>
<td style="width: 12.5535%; height: 50.3594px;">2^2</td>
<td style="width: 12.5535%; height: 50.3594px;">2^1</td>
<td style="width: 12.1255%; height: 50.3594px;">2^0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="width: 12.5535%; height: 50.3594px;"><strong>1</strong></td>
<td style="width: 12.5535%; height: 50.3594px;">0</td>
<td style="width: 12.5535%; height: 50.3594px;">0</td>
<td style="width: 12.5535%; height: 50.3594px;">0</td>
<td style="width: 12.5535%; height: 50.3594px;"><strong>1</strong></td>
<td style="width: 12.5535%; height: 50.3594px;">0</td>
<td style="width: 12.5535%; height: 50.3594px;">0</td>
<td style="width: 12.1255%; height: 50.3594px;"><strong>1</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>So we obtained our binary number corresponding to 137, which is 10001001!</p>
<h3>Final thoughts</h3>
<p>In this post, we have seen a short example about how numbers work with computers. Of course, there is much more to know but, when handling cryptocurrencies, it could be useful to know what is intended for a binary number and which is its value. We also may never have to perform the above-seen operations by ourselves</p>
<p>Whit the same criteria, we could also encounter base16 numbers (called hexadecimal), base64 numbers and so on...</p>

                <p>In previous posts we have seen how to use xpub keys to create <a href="https://anubitux.org/how-to-create-a-view-only-wallet-for-our-cold-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">view-only wallets</a> and how to <a href="https://anubitux.org/how-to-obtain-xpub-keys-with-anubitux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">obtain</a> them form our wallets.</p>
<p>Handling our xpub keys we have surely noticed that some clients are only using keys starting with "xpub" and others are also using keys starting with "ypub" and "zpub".</p>
<p>This may seem a bit confusing!</p>
<p> This is because some clients are only accepting xpub keys and want us to specify the derivation path to manage the addresses in the format we want. For instance, we could specify:</p>
<ul>
<li>m/44'/0'/0'/0 for legacy Bitcoin addresses;</li>
<li>m/49'/0'/0'/0 for segwit Bitcoin addresses;</li>
<li>m/84'/0'/0'/0 for native segwit Bitcoin addresses (bech32).</li>
</ul>
<p>Other clients, instead, are not allowing us to specify the derivation path since they are able to recognize it from the format of the master public key (like <a href="https://electrum.org/#home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Electrum</a>). For instance they are using:</p>
<ul>
<li>keys starting with xpub for legacy addresses;</li>
<li>keys starting with ypub for segwit addresses;</li>
<li>keys starting with zpub for native segwit addresses.</li>
</ul>
<p>We could use the right client depending on what kind of key we have but we do not want that! We want to use the client we feel comfortable with!</p>
<h3>Convert public keys</h3>
<p>To fix this, we can use the <a href="https://jlopp.github.io/xpub-converter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xpub-converter tool</a>, by <a href="https://www.lopp.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jameson Lopp</a>, that can be found in the "WalletTools" section of the Anu₿itux menu.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/63/xc1.png" alt="" width="800" height="467" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/63/responsive/xc1-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/63/responsive/xc1-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/63/responsive/xc1-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/63/responsive/xc1-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/63/responsive/xc1-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/63/responsive/xc1-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>We simply have to select the format of the key we want to obtain, paste the key in the proper box and here it is! We have obtained a master public key in the desired format and now we can use it with our favourite client. In this example we have obtained an xpub key from a zpub one.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/63/xc2.png" alt="" width="800" height="567" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/63/responsive/xc2-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/63/responsive/xc2-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/63/responsive/xc2-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/63/responsive/xc2-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/63/responsive/xc2-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/63/responsive/xc2-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<h3>An example</h3>
<p>Let's assume we have our Sparrow that is giving us an xpub key with the <code>m/84'/0'/0'</code> derivation path.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/63/xc5-2.png" alt="" width="800" height="310" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/63/responsive/xc5-2-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/63/responsive/xc5-2-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/63/responsive/xc5-2-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/63/responsive/xc5-2-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/63/responsive/xc5-2-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/63/responsive/xc5-2-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>If we want to set up a view-only wallet using the Electrum client, we won't be able to specify the derivation path to use with our xpub key and so we are going to obtain a view-only wallet with legacy addresses.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/63/xc6-2.png" alt="" width="800" height="409" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/63/responsive/xc6-2-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/63/responsive/xc6-2-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/63/responsive/xc6-2-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/63/responsive/xc6-2-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/63/responsive/xc6-2-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/63/responsive/xc6-2-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>To correctly set up our view-only wallet with Electrum, we first need to convert our master public key in the proper format. We can perform that with the Xpub-converter tool, chosing the zpub key format.  </p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/63/xc7.png" alt="" width="800" height="503" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/63/responsive/xc7-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/63/responsive/xc7-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/63/responsive/xc7-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/63/responsive/xc7-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/63/responsive/xc7-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/63/responsive/xc7-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Now we can create a new view-only wallet with Electrum, using the obtained zpub key.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/63/xc8.png" alt="" width="800" height="480" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/63/responsive/xc8-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/63/responsive/xc8-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/63/responsive/xc8-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/63/responsive/xc8-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/63/responsive/xc8-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/63/responsive/xc8-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>As we can see, we obtained the same addresses in both wallets.</p>

            <![CDATA[
                    <p><img src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/key-hole-gd944a9560_1920.jpg" class="type:primaryImage" alt="" /></p>
                <p>Xpub keys can be very useful to monitor our wallets without exposing our private keys. Keeping it very simple, with our mnemonic phrase we are obtaining an xpriv key from which all private keys are derived and an xpub key from which all public keys, and consequently all addresses, can be derived. Configuring our wallet to use xpub keys, we are setting up a <a href="https://anubitux.org/how-to-create-a-view-only-wallet-for-our-cold-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">view-only</a> wallet.</p>
<h3>How to obtain xpub keys</h3>
<p>Xpub keys can be obtained in many different ways, depending on what kind of solution we are using. Basically, it can be obtained from our mnemonic phrase, using tools like the Ian Colaman's one or from the menus of our desktop wallets.</p>
<h4>Ian Coleman</h4>
<p>With <a href="https://iancoleman.io/bip39/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ian Coleman</a>'s tool we can manage all that regerds BIP39 hierarchical deterministic wallets. We can generate a mnemonic phrase with the proper button or type/paste a seed in the proper box.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/xk1.png" alt="" width="750" height="350" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk1-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk1-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk1-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk1-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk1-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk1-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p class="msg msg--warning">If we are using this tool with a mnemonic phrase related to a wallet containing funds, we should do that in a live and offline Anu₿itux, to prevent any information leak. </p>
<p>Scrolling down the page we will find the xpub key derived from our mnemonic phrase.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/xk2.png" alt="" width="750" height="495" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk2-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk2-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk2-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk2-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk2-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk2-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Changing the Derivation Path, we can notice that the key format changes since it starts with xpub, ypub or zpub. Some clients are able to recognize derivation path directly from the key's format and others are only accepting xpub keys and need the desired derivation path to be specified. </p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/xk4.png" alt="" width="750" height="481" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk4-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk4-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk4-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk4-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk4-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk4-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<h4>Electrum</h4>
<p><a href="https://electrum.org/#home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Electrum</a> wallets commonly use a customized version of hierarchical deterministic wallets and not the BIP39 standard like many other clients. Also in this case we can obtain our xpub key simply using its GUI, clicking on the "Wallet" menu and on the "Information" entry. </p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/xk5.png" alt="" width="750" height="440" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk5-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk5-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk5-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk5-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk5-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk5-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>In this case we are obtaining a key starting as zpub, since we are using a wallet with native segwit addresses, commonly related to the BIP84 derivation path as seen above.</p>
<h4>Sparrow</h4>
<p>WIth <a href="https://sparrowwallet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sparrow wallet</a> we can see our master public key simply by clicking on the settings button on the left panel of our GUI.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/xk6.png" alt="" width="750" height="554" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk6-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk6-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk6-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk6-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk6-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk6-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Sparrow wallet will always show us an xpub key related to the derivation path used to obtain our addresses. In this case we have native segwit addresses and a normal xpub key (which is commonly related to legacy addresses) and a "Derivation" field were we can set the address format we need.</p>
<h4>Ledger Live</h4>
<p>Even with our <a href="https://www.ledger.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ledger</a> device, we can access our xpub key without the need to handle our mnemonic phrase. We have to connect our device, launch the Ledger Live client, <a href="https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005195945-Bitcoin-BTC-?support=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">create a Bitcoin account</a> from the "My Ledger" tab and then go to the "Accounts" tab. Here we can select the desired account, click on the settings button, show the advanced information and so we will have access to our xpub key and the derivation path related to the account we are using.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/xk9.png" alt="" width="750" height="732" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk9-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk9-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk9-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk9-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk9-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk9-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Ledger allows only to access the xpub key and will not show the other master public keys like ypub and zpub. So we also need to notice the derivation path if we need to use the key to set up a <a href="https://anubitux.org/how-to-create-a-view-only-wallet-for-our-cold-storage/">view-only wallet</a>. </p>
<h4>Trezor suite</h4>
<p>Also with <a href="https://trezor.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trezor</a> hardware wallets we can access our master public key. We have to go to the desired account, click on the "Details" button and on the "Show public key" button.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/xk10.png" alt="" width="750" height="314" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk10-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk10-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk10-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk10-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk10-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk10-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Now we can see our key in text and as a QR code.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/xk11.png" alt="" width="490" height="680" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk11-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk11-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk11-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk11-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk11-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk11-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>In this case we obtain a zpub key, so we'll not need to store the derivation path to obtain the correct addresses if we are setting up a <a href="https://anubitux.org/how-to-create-a-view-only-wallet-for-our-cold-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">view-only wallet</a>.</p>
<h4>Exodus</h4>
<p>WIth Exodus we commonly do not have access to crypto-nerd-stuff. We need to unlock a secret menu pressing <em>Ctrl+Shift+D</em>. Now, on the new menu, we can click on "Developer" and on "Export All Transactions".</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/xk7.png" alt="" width="750" height="424" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk7-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk7-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk7-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk7-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk7-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk7-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>So we can obtain a folder containing a zip archive with a lot of files in it, that is commonly created on the Desktop. In this archive we can find a text file named xpubs.txt, containing all the master public keys, related to all the supported coins.</p>
<h3><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/xk8.png" alt="" width="750" height="454" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk8-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk8-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk8-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk8-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk8-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk8-2xl.png 1600w"></figure></h3>
<h4>Blockstream Green</h4>
<p>Blockstream Green does not show xpub keys in the GUI so we can access them using the Ian Coleman's tool we have seen above with our mnemonic phrase or we can find them in the log file, placed in the home folder, in the <code><em>.local/share/Blockstream/Green/logs</em></code> file.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/xk12.png" alt="" width="750" height="192" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk12-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk12-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk12-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk12-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk12-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/60/responsive/xk12-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Near every xpub key we can also find the address format it has been used with, like p2pkh for legacy addresses and so on.</p>
<h3>Final thoughts</h3>
<p>Xpub keys are very powerful to monitor our wallets and also  to receive funds avoiding address reuse, without exposing our private keys. But, these keys are also very sensible because revealing it we are allowing someone to reconstruct our past transactions and even to monitor the future ones. So it is always a good idea to do some tests before handling our primary master public key.</p>

                    Creating a mnemonic phrase is a very sensitive operation that can be done in a lot of different ways. No one of them can be considered absolutely better than the others, we can only try to find out which one fits our needs in the&hellip;

                <p>Creating a mnemonic phrase is a very sensitive operation that can be done in a lot of different ways. No one of them can be considered absolutely better than the others, we can only try to find out which one fits our needs in the best way. We need to create it safely and store it in secure ways since it can be used to recover access to all the related private keys.</p>
<h3>What is a mnemonic phrase made of?</h3>
<p>A m<a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nemonic phrase</a> looks like a random sequence of words but it's not that easy. These words are taken from pre-established ordered <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/tree/master/bip-0039" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wordlists</a>, containing 2048 words. The last word of the list can't be a random one because it works as a checksum and helps us to verify that our phrase is correct.</p>
<p>Going deeper, our mnemonic seed represents our seed, which is made by a sequence of bits obtained joining our entropy with the checksum. Every word of the list represents an 11-bit sequence corresponding to the decimal value of the index of the word in the list. The last 11 bits, concerning to the last word of the mnemonic seed are made by the last part of the entropy and the checksum. So the last word needs to be chosen respecting the checksum obtained from our entropy.</p>
<h3>How is the checksum calculated?</h3>
<p>The checksum is obtained by taking a bit of the Sha256 hash of our entropy every 32 bits of entropy. So, for instance, with 128 bits of entropy we will have a 4 bits checksum (128/32=4). The first 121 bits of entropy (11*11=121) will always correspond to the same 11 words. The last word's index is made by the last seven bits of entropy and the checksum. So, as these 7 bits change, we will obtain a different checksum and a different last word for our mnemonic phrase.</p>
<p class="msg msg--info">We also discussed mnemonic phrases in <a href="https://anubitux.org/how-to-generate-a-mnemonic-seed-with-anubitux-and-a-dice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this post</a>. </p>
<h3>How to obtain the last word</h3>
<p>Let's assume we obtained the first words of our mnemonic phrase in a way we consider secure and safe according to our needs. Now we need to obtain the last word to have a complete mnemonic phrase but we may not be able to calculate the Sha256 value of our entropy and convert it to bits. Anu₿itux helps us with the <a href="https://github.com/ASeriousMister/LastWord" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lastword.py</a> tool!</p>
<p class="msg msg--warning">To use it in a safe way we are supposed to run it in a live session of Anu₿itux disabling all the network features with the proper desktop shortcut!</p>
<p>To run it we can type</p>
<p class="align-center"><code>lastword.py</code></p>
<p>in our terminal window and follow the prompted questions.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/61/lw1.png" alt="" width="730" height="493" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/61/responsive/lw1-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/61/responsive/lw1-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/61/responsive/lw1-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/61/responsive/lw1-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/61/responsive/lw1-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/61/responsive/lw1-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Now we can select how many words we have in our mnemonic phrase and the language of the wordlist we used.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/61/lw2.png" alt="" width="730" height="486" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/61/responsive/lw2-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/61/responsive/lw2-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/61/responsive/lw2-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/61/responsive/lw2-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/61/responsive/lw2-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/61/responsive/lw2-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Now we can provide the first words we obtained with our secure method.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/61/lw3.png" alt="" width="730" height="490" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/61/responsive/lw3-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/61/responsive/lw3-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/61/responsive/lw3-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/61/responsive/lw3-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/61/responsive/lw3-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/61/responsive/lw3-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>The tool is showing us the corresponding index of each word, so we can also check that we selected them correctly.</p>
<p>Now the tool will add some securely generated random bits to our entropy to reach the correct length. Then it will calculate the checksum and provide us our mnemonic phrase.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/61/lw4.png" alt="" width="730" height="491" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/61/responsive/lw4-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/61/responsive/lw4-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/61/responsive/lw4-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/61/responsive/lw4-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/61/responsive/lw4-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/61/responsive/lw4-2xl.png 1600w"> </figure>
<h3>Final thoughts</h3>
<p>Creating a mnemonic phrase has to be done very carefully since it is very hard to realize it has been compromised before we are losing all our coins.</p>
<p>This tool is just another solution to help users to create mnemonics in a secure and simple way. We do not have to forget that we also need to pay attention to the way we are storing it. Even in this case, there isn't a universal solution. If we need to access often our mnemonic to sign transactions it should be in a secure but accessible place or if we use it as a disaster recovery strategy, it can be stored in a very hard to reach place.</p>
<p>We should not look for the best strategy but we should seek the knowledge that will allow us to decide which strategy is the best for us.</p>

                    <p><img src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/fractal-g413a8f627_1920.jpg" class="type:primaryImage" alt="" /></p>
                <p>When handling our cryptocurrencies, we feel more comfortable being offline but, sometimes, we can't perform operations without using an internet connection. In these cases, we are always afraid that some sensible information could be leaked. With Anu₿itux we have a lot of countermeasures, like a <a href="https://anubitux.org/enable-network-monitor-in-anubitux-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">network monitor</a> on the lower right side of our screen and a desktop shortcut that disables all the communication features. If we want to perform some additional checks, even to verify if Anu₿itux is working properly, we can use <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wireshark</a>, a tool that captures all the incoming and outgoing network traffic and allows us to review it with a lot of powerful features like filters and streams reconstruction.</p>
<h3>First steps</h3>
<p>We can find wireshark in the Useful Tools menu. If we want to run it with root privileges, we can launch it from our terminal typing</p>
<p class="align-center"><code>sudo wireshark</code></p>
<p>Remember that in Anu₿itux the default root password is set to anubitux.</p>
<p>Now we can choose which network interface we want packets to be captured and start the acquisition by clicking on the shark's fin button.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/Selection_161.png" alt="" width="740" height="575" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_161-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_161-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_161-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_161-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_161-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_161-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<h3>Decrypting encrypted network traffic</h3>
<p>Nowadays most of the network traffic is encrypted with TLS, so even if we capture it, we won't be able to read it. To see what's flowing through our Internet connection, we need to configure a <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/27131/differences-between-the-terms-pre-master-secret-master-secret-private-key" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pre-master secret key</a>.</p>
<p>To prepare it, we need to set up an environment variable, setting up a file that stores handshakes and that can be used by Wireshark to decrypt network traffic.</p>
<p>Let's create an empty text file, for instance in our Documents folder and name it keylogfile.txt. Now we need to edit the SSLKEYLOGFILE environment variable so that the information we need will be stored in this file. We can do that by opening our terminal and typing </p>
<p class="align-center"><code>nano .bashrc</code></p>
<p>and adding this line at the end of the file</p>
<p class="align-center"><code>export SSLKEYLOGFILE=/home/anubitux/Documents/keylogfile.txt</code></p>
<p>Then we can close the nano text editor pressing Ctrl+X and saving the modified file (without renaming it).</p>
<p>Now we need to restart our Terminal so that it takes effect. To check if it worked, we can type</p>
<p class="align-center"><code>echo $SSLKEYLOGFILE</code></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/Selection_162.png" alt="" width="390" height="66" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_162-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_162-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_162-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_162-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_162-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_162-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>At this point we have to set up Wireshark to use the content of this file to decrypt the captured network traffic. To do that we have to open Wireshark, go to Edit and click on Preferences, then under the protocols list select TLS and, clicking on the Browse button, provide the keylogfile we created.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/Selection_163.png" alt="" width="740" height="578" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_163-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_163-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_163-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_163-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_163-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_163-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Now Wireshark will be able to decrypt network traffic and show it in plain text.</p>
<h3>Capturing traffic</h3>
<p>Finally, we can start capturing our traffic by clicking on the shark's fin button. To see something going on, let's start the Firefox browser (it may be necessary to start it from the Terminal, to make sure it stores keys in the keylogfile.txt file).</p>
<p>Then we can visit some websites that use HTTPS, like anubitux.org and iancoleman.io. After browsing some pages we can stop the network capture and review it.</p>
<p>In the below picture, we can see an example with a captured TLS packet.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/Selection_164.png" alt="" width="930" height="826" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_164-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_164-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_164-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_164-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_164-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_164-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>To see its content we need to click on the proper button in the lower part of the user interface. These buttons would not be available without setting up the key log file as we did before.</p>
<p>In this case, it is a packet related to the HTTPS certificate verification process. With most of the websites, even if packets are unencrypted, we won't see the plain text because the information are sent in gzip format. Sometimes Wireshark will be able to see it, providing us another button to see the uncompressed content of packets.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/Selection_165.png" alt="" width="570" height="71" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_165-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_165-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_165-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_165-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_165-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_165-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>If we are interested in packets we exchanged with a specific website, like iancoleman.io, we can filter our list knowing its IP address. To check it out we can ping it, as seen above.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/Selection_166.png" alt="" width="730" height="261" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_166-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_166-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_166-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_166-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_166-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_166-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Now we can set up filters in the proper box, based on the IP address we have found. To see both incoming and outgoing traffic the syntax is</p>
<p class="align-center"><code>ip.src == 99.86.159.30 or ip.dst == 99.86.159.30</code></p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/Selection_167.png" alt="" width="910" height="827" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_167-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_167-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_167-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_167-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_167-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/15/responsive/Selection_167-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>In the picture we can see a packet we have sent to iancoleman.io's website with the details of our browser. It was an encrypted package and we can see its content only thanks to the setup we have made.</p>
<h3>Final thoughts</h3>
<p>Wireshark is a very powerful tool to analyze network traffic. In this post, we have seen only a few examples of how to use it but it can be applied in a lot of different situations, not only for analyzing network activity but also for penetration testing and security audits. It also requires very good skills to be used properly, since it collects thousands of packets every few seconds and most of them seem to be meaningless without knowing what is going on. There are a lot of guides and tutorials online about how to use it, even on the official <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/#learnWS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>. </p>

                    <p><img src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/57/front-2.jpg" class="type:primaryImage" alt="" /></p>
                <p>After having broadly reviewed what we could call the <a href="https://anubitux.org/from-wax-tablets-to-elliptical-curves-a-brief-history-of-cryptography-part-one/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">genesis of cryptography</a>, in this second article we will take us far forward in time, up to the present day.</p>
<p>With the advent of modern electronic computers, it has been possible to exploit the computational power of processors in order to automate the procedures for coding and decoding messages.</p>
<p>Conceptually, even though centuries have passed, we still think in terms of algorithm, which represents the cryptographic method, and key, a string chosen by the user useful for encrypting and decrypting the message.</p>
<p>A substantial difference with respect to the past is given by the fact that electronic computers use only binary numbers as inputs, i.e., the numbers 0 and 1, with the combination of which all the other numbers, letters and symbols are composed. In particular, for the formation of the alphabet a conversion method called ASCII is used which allows to represent up to 128 alphabetic and symbolic characters through the combination of 7 binary digits.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the introduction of block encryption algorithms has made it possible to speed up the encryption/decryption processes by allowing the algorithm to be applied no longer to single elements, but to entire blocks of elements (composed of N bits), on which it is It is possible to carry out different types of operations, called iterations or rounds which, performed in sequence on each block processed, will lead to a greater or lesser complexity of the encryption algorithm.</p>
<p>Since the 1970s, together with the diffusion of personal computers, there has been great attention to the development of new encryption methods, which guarantee the best compromise between the level of security achieved and the complexity in computational terms of the algorithm adopted. The first of these was created by the German Horst Feistel (German naturalized US cryptographer who worked at IBM on the development of several famous ciphers) who, with his Lucifer cipher , laid the foundations for the Data Encryption Standard (called DES ) first protocol cipher officially adopted by the National Bureau of Standards of the United States ( National Institute of Standards and Technology, an agency of the government of the United States of America that deals with the management of technologies, today NIST ) in order to encrypt documents containing sensitive information ( a brief explanation of DES is available in <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.197.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this NIST document</a>).</p>
<p>After a few years, despite the improvements made over time, the DES protocol was supplanted by the more performing and secure Advanced Encryption Standard (= AES ) which, with its 128-bit blocks, could use 128, 192 or 256-bit keys and which , therefore, has been adopted by NIST to encrypt documents classified even as Top Secret (on <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.197.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this NIST page</a> an excellent presentation of the AES algorithm).</p>
<h3>Symmetric encryption and public key encryption</h3>
<p>After these very brief references, which I hope to have allowed us to understand how and why we have passed from an analogical to a digital encryption method, it would be appropriate to focus our attention on the functioning of some of them.</p>
<p>Among the encryption methods currently most used in the IT environment, a substantial distinction could be made based on the type of key used: symmetric key encryption and public key encryption.</p>
<p>In the first case, the key to encrypt and the one to decrypt will coincide, in the second case, however, it will be necessary to use two different keys (even if "linked" to each other).</p>
<p>One of the major problems of the first encryption methods, such as DES or AES, just mentioned, consisted in the need to create a rather long key, so as to be reasonably sure that the computational capabilities of the computers could not perform a so-called brute attack force, which is a method that consists of trying all possible combinations of keys. If it is true that it is possible to minimize this risk by simply increasing the length of the encryption key, so as to exponentially increase the calculation times and make a brute-force attack very difficult (if not impossible even with current hardware devices), one must however consider that the main flaw of the symmetric key method was the extreme difficulty in communicating the key to the recipient in a secure way.</p>
<p>This delicate step has been the Achilles' heel of encryption methods of this type for decades, prompting some scholars to look for one that would allow the sender and recipient of the message to communicate in total security.</p>
<p>In fact, there was a piece of history still to be written in cryptography. The moment this dilemma was resolved, a profound revolution would have taken place, in cryptography in particular, but also more generally in the methods of communication believed to be secure until then.</p>
<p>This epochal discovery took place in the 70s in America, developing the intuition had by the mathematicians Hellman, Diffie and Merkle according to which it was possible to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">exchange unencrypted values ​​useful for generating one's own encryption keys</a>, thanks to the use of functions called unidirectional , i.e. via non-reversible functions.</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards, thanks to the application of other scholars and cryptography enthusiasts such as Rivest, Shamir and Adleman , the cryptography system considered since then among the most important and innovative of this branch of science was developed: the RSA system (<a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/Rsapaper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here the paper</a>), also known as the public key cryptography system.</p>
<p>The innovative idea consisted in the presence of two different keys, one public, used to encrypt the message, the other private, used to decrypt it. This was made possible thanks to the use of a special one-way function, i.e., a function that was normally very difficult to reverse except under certain conditions (=the use of the private key).</p>
<p>In practice, to use this encryption, each user should have two keys, first of all creating a private key, to be jealously guarded, then deriving a public key from it. This key, as explained by the name itself, is not secret, on the contrary, for the purpose of correct encryption it is necessary to communicate it to the sender of the message, who will use it to encrypt his message thus sending it to the recipient without the worry of having to communicate the key, with the risks that would derive from it. Once the message has been delivered, for example via email, the recipient just has to decrypt the message using his own private key, the only one capable of inverting the special one-way function that underlies this method.</p>
<p>The classic example reported in scientific literature wants Alice and Bob to be willing to exchange a text message. Alice asks Bob for her public key, and Bob sends it to her. Using Bob's public key, Alice can encrypt the message and can proceed to send it. Once Bob has received the message, he can decrypt it using his private key.</p>
<p>In reality, the function used to implement this method is defined as unidirectional, but this does not mean that it is completely irreversible since, through factoring, it is possible to try to go back to the prime numbers used for the implementation of this cryptographic system, even if it is extremely expensive in terms of computational power. To overcome this type of problem, the use of keys that are at least 2048 bits long is now recommended.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://www.usna.edu/Users/cs/wcbrown/courses/si110AY13S/lec/l26/lec.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this page</a> you will find an explanation of this algorithm, even with some small illustrations that can facilitate understanding 😊. </p>
<p>For fans of numbers and mathematical problems, I recommend reading the book <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Xfermat-S-Last-Theorem-Pb/dp/0007902492" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fermat's Last Theorem</a>. The adventure of a genius, of a mathematical problem and of the man who solved it (I inserted the link on Amazon for simplicity's sake, but you can find it everywhere, even in any traditional bookstore) once again by Simon Singh, who managed to make a topic in itself difficult exciting, and moreover he succeeded in the huge aim of making me read an enormous amount of figures without me being bored!</p>
<h3>Hash functions</h3>
<p>Taking up the concept of non-invertible function described above, it will be easier at this point to introduce the concept of hash, since it is based on a one-way function, simple to compute but (hopefully) impossible to invert.</p>
<p>The purpose of this algorithm is to reduce a text (or input) of arbitrary length into a string (called hash value or message digest) of a fixed length.</p>
<p>Moreover, in addition to non-reversibility, therefore the impossibility of going back to the initial message starting from the hash value, this function must respect other important characteristics:</p>
<p>    • must produce a string that always has the same length regardless of the size of the input;<br>    • it must allow that, if the hashing function is repeated on the same message, the same output value is always calculated;<br>    • finally, it must ensure that at the slightest change in the input, the algorithm returns a completely different hash value.</p>
<p>The most used hashing protocols are: the MD5 algorithm , one of the first algorithms used for this purpose, very fast and still used to check the integrity of files; the family of SHA algorithms offers an increasing safety factor, the best known are SHA-1 and SHA-256 ; the series of RIPEMD algorithms , the best known of which is the RIPEMD-160, born as a European response to the American MD5 algorithm.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://md5calc.com/hash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this address</a> we can have fun calculating the hash value for any portion of text and for files up to 10 MB, using numerous hashing algorithms.</p>
<p>The applications of such a function are many and more widespread than one might imagine. A first example of the use of hashing functions are password databases, where passwords are saved in the form of hash values ​​in order to prevent malicious people who come into possession of them from going back to the real passwords. </p>
<p>Another example would be file integrity checking, where you use the hash value as a checksum to make sure a particular file has not changed.</p>
<p>It is possible to verify the integrity of a message, by comparing the hash value calculated before and after the transmission of the message and verifying that no one has altered the source code since, due to the properties of this function, a minimal variation of the input would cause a complete hash value change. A useful application of this feature is the comparison with pre-compiled hash lists, in order to be able to quickly search for files already registered as viruses or containing malware in general.</p>
<p>Also, in computer forensics the hash function is widely used, in order to preserve the data that is acquired from any type of alteration or manipulation, allowing a rapid integrity check at any time. All data that is duplicated for forensic activities, in fact, assumes validity only if their congruence with the original data is verified.</p>
<p>For those who have never heard of computer forensics, I quote a very comprehensive definition:</p>
<p>“Forensic computer science is the discipline that studies the research, identification, collection, preservation, acquisition, analysis, presentation and evaluation of computer data for evidentiary purposes, in the context of criminal or civil procedural law. The science of computer forensics unfolds in different sectors of technology in order to allow the computer expert to acquire and analyse different types of devices and data.”.</p>

<p>Any digital element can be used as an input value for a hash function. A string of text, an image, an audio file, an entire hard disk or any other digital data can "pass" through a specific hash function, returning a digest that will always have the same length, based on the algorithm used.</p>
<p>A few brief examples will undoubtedly offer an overview of the above concept, making the characteristics and utility of hash functions immediately identifiable. In particular, for such examples, the SHA-1 algorithm was used:</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center" ><img loading="lazy" src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/57/hash1-2.png" alt="" width="721" height="123" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/57/responsive/hash1-2-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/57/responsive/hash1-2-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/57/responsive/hash1-2-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/57/responsive/hash1-2-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/57/responsive/hash1-2-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/57/responsive/hash1-2-2xl.png 1600w">

<figcaption >Fig. 2: Example Hash function 2: This is an example text message!</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Note how, as a single character in the input value varies between the two examples above (replacing the final punctuation mark of the example in Fig. 1 with an exclamation mark of the input value in Fig. 2), the result obtained was completely different.</p>
<p>In the same way, it will be easy to observe that, using a much longer text as input, the hash function always returns a value of the same length (the SHA-1 algorithm, taken for example, generates a message digest with a length of 160 bits, represented with 40 characters in hexadecimal value):</p>

</figure>
<h3>Digital signature</h3>
<p>A further application of public key cryptography, coupled with the characteristics of the hash algorithm, was the introduction of the so-called digital signature.</p>
<p>We have already seen that, given a document with content of arbitrary length, it is possible to reduce it to a string using the hash function. This string can be encrypted with the sender's private key, reversing the usual order. At this point, the document is ready to be sent unencrypted to the recipient, together with the digital signature and the sender's public key. The receiver, in turn, using the public key received from the sender, will be able to be certain that the message is authentic and also, by calculating the hash value, that no one has been able to make changes to the original message.</p>
<p>The following diagram will be useful in order to better understand what steps are necessary to apply the Digital Signature to a document:</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center" ><img loading="lazy" src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/57/firma-digitale.png" alt="" width="680" height="674" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/57/responsive/firma-digitale-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/57/responsive/firma-digitale-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/57/responsive/firma-digitale-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/57/responsive/firma-digitale-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/57/responsive/firma-digitale-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/57/responsive/firma-digitale-2xl.png 1600w">
<figcaption >Fig. 4: Operation diagram of the Digital Signature</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In recent years, the digital signature has been widely used as well as further implemented, including through the use of smart cards, so as to assume a central role in digital communications, especially in the Public Administration. With D.Lgs. 82/2005, followed by D.Lgs. 235/2010, the Code for Digital Administration was introduced into Italian legislation, a body of rules with which the utmost importance was given to digital communications in the Public Administration, elevating the digital signature to a signature completely similar to the handwritten one (as indicated in article 21, paragraph 2, of Decreto Legislativo 7 marzo 2005, n. 82, published in the “Gazzetta Ufficiale” n. 112 of 16/05/2005).<br>Also in the Bitcoin protocol the developers have used the digital signature, together with the hash function, to digitally sign the transactions and verify that they originate from the real sender, but we will talk about this in the third and final part.</p>

<h5>What is Anu₿itux for?</h5>
<p>Anu₿itux is a customized Linux distribution based on Debian. It is designed to work as a live environment and aims to provide a safe and simple solution to use and manage cryptocurrency wallets, even for non-experienced users.</p>
<h5>What is the default user password?</h5>
<p>Anu₿itux has a default user that is <strong>anubitux</strong> and its password is <strong>anubitux</strong>. The user anubitux was added to the sudoers so it is possible to run commands that need root privileges.</p>
<h5>How to set up root password in Anu₿itux?</h5>
<p>Some actions, like autentication on some Wi-Fi network could need a root password to be performed. The user anubitux is in the sudoers but its password will not be accepted as a root password. To solve this simply run</p>
<p><code>sudo passwd</code></p>
<p>in your terminal and chose a password. If you are using Anu₿itux in live mode, this password will not be stored anywhere and has to be set-up again at every reboot.</p>
<h5>How to use Anu₿itux?</h5>
<p>Anu₿itux has beed designed to work as a live environment or, only for training purposes, as an installable Linux distribution that can be used as a virtual machine or on a dedicated device. To run it, please refer to <a href="https://anubitux.org/how-to-use-anubitux-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this post</a>.</p>
<h5>Anu₿itux does not start, what should I do?</h5>
<p>Some devices could not be able to run live Linux distros properly. Anu₿itux integrates a lot of firmwares and drivers but sometimes this is not enough. When starting, operating systems check the available hardware and power settings with a standard named ACPI. On some devices this check fails and the system does not start. To avoid this issue it is enough to disable this check. On the boot screen, when "Live (amd64)" is selected hit e to edit the grub config, after "quiet splasc" write acpi=off and hit enter (do not worry if line splits). Now hit Ctrl + X to boot.</p>
<h5>How to verify Anu₿itux?</h5>
<p>Every time a new release of Anu₿itux is released, checksums are updated on the <a href="https://anubitux.org/download-anubitux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">download page</a>. They are signen with our PGP key that we share on our <a href="https://github.com/ASeriousMister/Anubitux-PGP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>, on <a href="https://pastebin.com/bqmy9y2P" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PasteBin</a> and on <a href="https://keybase.io/anubitux" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KeyBase</a>. To verify the signed checksums, please refer to <a href="https://anubitux.org/how-to-verify-your-downloaded-anubitux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this post</a>.</p>
<h5>How to verify Anu₿itux's tools?</h5>
<p>Anu₿itux's tools have been downloaded from the official debian reposotpries, from GitHub or as .appimage from the officla websites. GitHub tools and .appimages are placed in the /home/anubitux/Tools/ directory. Users can verify the source of the tools like Python scripts and verify checksums of the appimages comparing them to the official webisites of the tools. Doing so, users do not need to trust Anu₿itux but can easily verify by themselves that the Tools are genuine. All the links to sources and official websites can be found <a href="https://anubitux.org/what-is-anubitux-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<h5>How to update Anu₿itux?</h5>
<p>Anu₿itux works primarly as a live envirnment. Running commands like sudo apt update or sudo apt upgrade will have effect only on the current session and will not affect appimages and open source tools. The only way to update Anu₿itux is to <a href="https://anubitux.org/download-anubitux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">download</a> the last version checking the <a href="https://anubitux.org/changelog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">changelog</a>. We are releasing frequently a new version of Anu₿itux containing updates, some fixes and including users' <a href="https://anubitux.org/meet-the-anubitux-project/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">suggestions</a>.</p>
<h5>What should I do if I do not know how Anu₿itux's tools work?</h5>
<p>One of the main rules in the crypto world is "do not trust, verify!". Anu₿itux uses open source tools that can be verified by yourself or by someone you trust and appimages, so that you can verify the checksum of the tools by yourself referencing to the official sites. Link to sources and official websites can be found on <a href="https://anubitux.org/what-is-anubitux-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this page</a>. If you are in doubt about any tool or feature do not hesitate to <a href="https://anubitux.org/meet-the-anubitux-project/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contact us</a>.</p>

                <p>Anu₿itux is a linux distro based on Debian. By default, Anu₿itux has the network monitor enabled in the lower panel, but, it could not show any data because it needs to be configured accordingly to the network interfaces of the device you are using.</p>
<p>To make it work properly, right click on the right part of the lower panel, near the notification area, as shown below.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/53/Selection_128.png" alt="" width="470" height="289" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/53/responsive/Selection_128-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/53/responsive/Selection_128-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/53/responsive/Selection_128-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/53/responsive/Selection_128-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/53/responsive/Selection_128-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/53/responsive/Selection_128-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Then click on Network interfaces and select the interfaces you want to be monitored, to show the inbound and outbound network traffic on your panel and always be able to see if something is going on.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/53/Selection_129.png" alt="" width="470" height="321" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://anubitux.org/media/posts/53/responsive/Selection_129-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/53/responsive/Selection_129-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/53/responsive/Selection_129-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/53/responsive/Selection_129-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/53/responsive/Selection_129-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/53/responsive/Selection_129-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Now you will be able to see two coloured waves on the panel that symbolize the network load.</p>

<p>This feature is very userful to notice if a service or a tool is doing some unexpected network traffic.</p>
