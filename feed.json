            "content_html": "\n  <p>\n    In Anthony F. Janson's work, History of art, the following statement is attributed to the absolute genius Leonardo da Vinci, referring to a poet who would be “...overcome by sleep and hunger before (being able to) describe in words what a painter is capable (of painting) in an instant.”<br>Certainly the forms in which it is possible to represent reality today have evolved (although we may regret some of the artists of days gone by), but the basic concept expressed by Leonardo remains the same:<br>\n  </p>\n\n    <blockquote class=\"blockquote\">\n      ONE IMAGE IS WORTH MORE THAN A THOUSAND WORDS.\n    </blockquote>\n\n  <p>\n    In the field of cryptocurrency investigations, this adage is truer than ever. There is often a need to graphically track the myriad transactions being followed, and a graphical visualization can help to make sense of the entire investigative scheme.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    We are helped on this issue by MetaSleuth, a platform created for investigating and tracking crypto-related activities. We particularly like it for its ability to create cost-free charts.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Of course, MetaSleuth is one of the many resources we have included as a Firefox favorite in the collection dedicated to BlockExplorers.\n  </p>\n\n    <figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\">\n      <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/81/Metasleuth-on-Anubitux2.jpeg\" height=\"790\" width=\"1692\" alt=\"\"  sizes=\"(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)\" srcset=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/81/responsive/Metasleuth-on-Anubitux2-xs.jpeg 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/81/responsive/Metasleuth-on-Anubitux2-sm.jpeg 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/81/responsive/Metasleuth-on-Anubitux2-md.jpeg 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/81/responsive/Metasleuth-on-Anubitux2-lg.jpeg 1024w\">\n      <figcaption>MetaSleuth on Anubitux</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n  <p>\n    So, let's take a simple case study to show how we could use MetaSleuth for our purposes. We need to find the destination of the funds received (by our imaginary <em>bad guy</em>) at the following address:<br><strong>BG) 0x65dd24d1d98be9db903e846d753112eb86311347<br></strong>through the following 3 transactions:<br>1)&nbsp;0x7aebc916b5c772fbb1898c663dd718410298c9da5a20b823105b21326b0c44f9<br>2)&nbsp;0x1cbf1473fcf15f3e502424ddddc40d177b53e054dcbe6dd3fafacd3a804431c7<br>3)&nbsp;0x9443dcd3c790eefa8b7755a21b66c70ff23c78185cb759c6fbf0b78b58ae03a1<br>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Firstly, after logging into the platform, we should enter the address we are looking for into the centre bar on the main screen.

This doesn't mean our coins will definitely be stolen, but we should never forget that with cryptocurrencies, we are our own bank.

We could say that they are so called because keys are stored on desktop or mobile devices.</p>\n<p>These kind of wallets generally:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>use mnemonic seeds to backup keys;</li>\n<li>are always connected to the Internet when we are using them;</li>\n<li>could handle many cryptocurrencies;</li>\n<li>offer many security settings;</li>\n<li>are as secure as the device we are using to run them;</li>\n<li>can handle wallets generated with other clients.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Basically, the security of this kind of wallets relies on the device, on how safely we are storing our seed and on our ability to detect scams or any other kind of attack.</p>\n<p>Desktop and mobile wallets are not suggested just for holding or storing cryptocurrencies, since we are exposing our wallets in the moments we connect our devices to the Internet. Nowadays it is very easy to encounter malware that could try to steal our cryptos. They are usually injected with social engineering techniques or they come packed with other software, often realized for illegal things like cracking licenses or downloading copyright protected media files.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/36/Selection_034.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"674\" sizes=\"(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)\" srcset=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/36/responsive/Selection_034-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/36/responsive/Selection_034-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/36/responsive/Selection_034-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/36/responsive/Selection_034-lg.png 1024w\">\n<figcaption >A software that is widely used to spread malware</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>These wallets can be used as daily solution when we are often receiving transaction and making payments. In these cases they can be very convenient.</p>\n<h4>Hardware wallets</h4>\n<p>There are two kinds of hardware wallets:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>those used as cold storage solutions;</li>\n<li>those used to improve the security of our cryptos;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the first case, we are referring to wallets that are keeping our private keys isolated, as <a href=\"https://github.com/ASeriousMister/DiceTracker.py\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">paper wallets</a> or devices like <a href=\"https://opendime.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">OpenDime</a> do.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/36/Selection_061.png\" alt=\"opendime\" width=\"600\" height=\"316\" sizes=\"(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)\" srcset=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/36/responsive/Selection_061-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/36/responsive/Selection_061-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/36/responsive/Selection_061-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/36/responsive/Selection_061-lg.png 1024w\"></figure>\n<p>These solutions are very powerful to receive coins or to store coins in a very safe way when we do not need to spend them. They are safe as long as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>they have been generated in a <a href=\"https://anubitux.org/how-to-create-a-paper-wallet-with-anubitux/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">secure way</a>;</li>\n<li>they are stored in a safe place;</li>\n<li>the mathematics behind cryptocurrencies does its job.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When we need to <a href=\"https://anubitux.org/how-to-spend-a-paper-wallet-with-anubitux/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">move coins</a> from these wallets, we should always empty them, since starting from this moment, we exposed our private keys and they can't be considered that secure anymore. If we do not need to spend the whole amount we are storing, it could be a very good idea to move funds to a new secure cold storage.</p>\n<p>In the second case we are talking about hardware wallets like <a href=\"https://trezor.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Trezor</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ledger.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ledger</a>, <a href=\"https://www.safepal.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Safepal</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ellipal.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ellipal</a>, etc. This kind of wallets can be considered very safe even for using cryptos on a daily basis. Indeed, they handle all the signing process without revealing the private keys they are handling. The client prepares the transaction, sends it to the hardware wallets that signs it with the correct private keys and sends it back to the client that now can propagate it to the network. These wallets often require a physical interaction by the user to perform the signing process so, even if the device we are using has been compromised, no one will be able to move our cryptos without being near our hardware wallet. On the counter, these solutions, like desktop wallets, use mnemonic seeds as backup method. So, they can be considered safe as long we are keeping our mnemonic seed in a secure place. This feature makes them useless as cold storage solutions, since we are already storing our seed in a safe place without the need to move funds. Store them also on an electronic device does not add any security to our cold storage. Also the process with which they collect entropy to generate our seed, has not to be considered safer than the methods used by other solutions. We could obtain a mnemonic seed even <a href=\"https://github.com/ASeriousMister/Dice2Seed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">rolling our dice</a> many times and converting results into entropy to obtain a mnemonic seed.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/36/Selection_202.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"668\" sizes=\"(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)\" srcset=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/36/responsive/Selection_202-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/36/responsive/Selection_202-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/36/responsive/Selection_202-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/36/responsive/Selection_202-lg.png 1024w\"></figure>\n<h3>Final thoughts</h3>\n<p>So, which one can be considered as the best solutions? Maybe no one, because any solution has many pros and cons and has been designed to satisfy different needs. Online wallets are useful since they can be accessed from anywhere, desktop wallets give us the control over our keys and can be used on regular basis, hardware wallets can be used as cold storage solutions or for keeping our private keys safer.</p>\n<p>Therefore the best solution could be using all these solutions, separating coins in consideration of what we want to use them for, so we can always be ready to send coins to a safe cold storage or we can quickly perform a good trade on our preferred exchange platform. We also need to consider that this strategy avoids us from having a single point of failure since if one of our wallets gets compromised, we are not going to loose our coins.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, we should not rely on a single solution and should not adopt solutions without previously analyzing them. We should only use wallets we have analysed and tested, using them only when we feel pretty comfortable with their features.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><a href=\"https://buymeacoffee.com/anubitux\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/36/buybeer-md.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"256\" height=\"171\" sizes=\"(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)\" srcset=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/36/responsive/buybeer-md-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/36/responsive/buybeer-md-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/36/responsive/buybeer-md-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/36/responsive/buybeer-md-lg.png 1024w\"></figure></a></p>",

The tool tries to help us showing a clear and big message saying \"VolumeUp\".</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"file:///home/misterserious/Dropbox/Publii/anubituxorg/input/media/posts/72/MicCheck.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"461\" sizes=\"(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)\" srcset=\"file:///home/misterserious/Dropbox/Publii/anubituxorg/input/media/posts/72/responsive/MicCheck-xs.png 300w ,file:///home/misterserious/Dropbox/Publii/anubituxorg/input/media/posts/72/responsive/MicCheck-sm.png 480w ,file:///home/misterserious/Dropbox/Publii/anubituxorg/input/media/posts/72/responsive/MicCheck-md.png 768w ,file:///home/misterserious/Dropbox/Publii/anubituxorg/input/media/posts/72/responsive/MicCheck-lg.png 1024w\">\n<figcaption >Checking the microphone with the MicCheck tool included in AnuBitux</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3>How to use the tool</h3>\n<p>Once we are sure that our hardware is working properly and we took care of our OpSec, we can launch the tool directly from the <em>Wallet Generators</em> menu or typing <em>mic2seed.py</em> in our terminal.</p>\n<p>If we are sure that our hardware is working properly, we only have to wait about 30 seconds to obtain our new random mnemonic seed.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/73/mic2seed1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"441\" sizes=\"(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)\" srcset=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/73/responsive/mic2seed1-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/73/responsive/mic2seed1-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/73/responsive/mic2seed1-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/73/responsive/mic2seed1-lg.png 1024w\">\n<figcaption >Mnemonic seed obtained with explanation of all the indexes and the words</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>The tool also provides the entropy used to obtain the mnemonic seed and the indexes of the words to check them from the <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BIP39 list</a>.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/73/mic2seed2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"273\" sizes=\"(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)\" srcset=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/73/responsive/mic2seed2-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/73/responsive/mic2seed2-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/73/responsive/mic2seed2-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/73/responsive/mic2seed2-lg.png 1024w\">\n<figcaption >Entropy obtained through the microphone</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"msg msg--info\">On our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@AnuBitux\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">YouTube channel</a> you can find a demonstration on how to use this tool!</p>\n<p align=\"center\"><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/b23h-PbYOzA?si=AHMcEF8ZdLFpTobS\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><a href=\"https://www.buymeacoffee.com/anubitux\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/73/buybeer.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"256\" height=\"171\" sizes=\"(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)\" srcset=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/73/responsive/buybeer-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/73/responsive/buybeer-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/73/responsive/buybeer-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/73/responsive/buybeer-lg.png 1024w\"></figure></a></p>",

            "content_html": "<p>In some cases it may be necessary to create private keys to securely store funds for others, for instance, when seizing cryptocurrency for the judicial authority or when acting as a crypto custodian. When creating the private key with the common tools, even when using all the precautions (i.e. using a live working environment like AnuBitux, disabling all the network connections, using a good source of entropy, etc.), the operator, even if only for a few seconds, is gaining access to a private key related to funds which are not going to belong to him. To avoid it, multisignature wallets ciuld be created, but this solution is not directly and easily available for all the currencies and may also be pretty difficult to use for most of the users.</p>\n<p>As more complex is the solution we use to store cryptocurrencies, as more it is easy to lose access to them.</p>\n<p>To solve this, we developed something called \"<strong>Blind protocol for crypto wallet generation</strong>\". This protocol provides two tools, <a href=\"https://github.com/ASeriousMister/BlindGen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BlindGen</a> and BlindDecode.</p>\n<p>The BlindGen tool allows <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>two user</strong></span> to create half part of the private key, without ever gaining access to the whole private key and then provides a printable paper wallet only containing the public address. The BlindDecode tool allows the users to obtain the whole private key. It is intended to be used only when in need to spend the funds received on the generated address.</p>\n<h3>OpSec first</h3>\n<p>Before using the tool, it may be a good idea to use the \"Offline\" shortcut from the AnuBitux desktop, in order to disable all the possible connection to external devices and avoid leaking any kind of information. It is also mandatory to use AnuBitux in live mode and not in a virtual machine and to operate in a safe environment.</p>\n<h3>How to use the tool</h3>\n<p>The tool is provided with a very easy to use graphical interface.

The outputs of each Whirlpool mix are always identical resulting in every mix having a lot of possible interpretations. Anyone trying to analyze the blockchain and looking at a Whirlpool transaction cannot say for sure which output corresponds to which input. </p>\n<p>Each of the five Whirlpool participants submits 1 input into the transaction. For a mix to start, a minimum of two of these participants must be new entrants to the pool. These new entrants are known as ‘premixers’ and they are required at every Whirlpool mix. Requiring two premixers to trigger a mix ensures that new liquidity forms part of every cycle and prevents the same pool UTXO’s continually mixing with each other.</p>\n<h3>How does a Whirlpool transaction look like?</h3>\n<p>As stated above, a whirlpool transaction requires 5 participants sending 5 identical outputs. Here you can see an example of a <a href=\"https://mempool.space/tx/3795565f9d3b0885f9b702a6a216653afe03d8bf647d4f640afb4227654703c1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Whirlpool transaction</a>.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/71//Whirlpool.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"823\" sizes=\"(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)\" srcset=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/71//responsive/Whirlpool-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/71//responsive/Whirlpool-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/71//responsive/Whirlpool-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/71//responsive/Whirlpool-lg.png 1024w\">\n<figcaption >An example Whirlpool transaction</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>As you can see, two addresses are providing bigger inputs, they are the new entrants, providing a little extra-amount to cover transaction fees.</p>\n<h3>Where are the mixed funds?</h3>\n<p>It is very important to point out that Whirlpool works in a totally <strong>non custodial</strong> way. Funds are never sent to third parties, there's only a coordinator server orchestrating the process without knowing which funds belong to each of the involved addresses.</p>\n<p>Among the mixing process, funds are sent to addresses based on the same seed  used to create the BIP39 software wallet you are using. Whirlpool just uses different standards with an offset on the index.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--info\">Remember that a <a href=\"https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/keys/hd-wallets/derivation-paths/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">derivation path</a> is something like m/44’/60’/0’/0/0. it is tellig your hierarchical deterministic wallet to:</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--info\">- start at the master key (m);<br>- use the BIP44 standard (44);<br>- derive keys for Ethereum (60, use 0 for bitcoin);<br>- do not derive a change address (first zero, use 1 for change addresses);<br>- the index of the address (last zero).</p>\n<p>In detail, Whirlpool is using the following <a href=\"https://github.com/Samourai-Wallet/samourai-wallet-android/blob/develop/Guides/Restore%20%26%20Recovery.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">derivation paths</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"auto\">Deposit: <code>m/44'|49'|84'|47'/0'/0'</code></li>\n<li dir=\"auto\">Bad Bank: <code>m/84'/0'/2147483644'</code></li>\n<li dir=\"auto\">Pre Mix: <code>m/84'/0'/2147483645'</code></li>\n<li dir=\"auto\">Post Mix: <code>m/84'/0'/2147483646'</code></li>\n<li dir=\"auto\">Ricochet: <code>m/44'|49'|84'/0'/2147483647'</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>That means that we can always recover all our funds so long as you have the seed.</p>\n<h3>Recover access to the funds</h3>\n<p>Since the Samourai app may not be available anymore, to access funds held through this client it may be possible to use other clients supporting Whirlpool mixes, like <a href=\"https://sparrowwallet.com/docs/mixing-whirlpool.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sparrow wallet</a> (<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20240405202436/https://www.sparrowwallet.com/docs/mixing-whirlpool.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">backup link</a>). If also Sparrow wallet does not work with Whirlpool anymore, it is enough to use it or other fully feathured clients, like <a href=\"https://electrum.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Electrum</a>, manually specifying the desired derivation path in the wallet setup wizard.</p>\n<p>To see the funds used through Whirlpool with Sparrow wallet, when importing a new keystore based on the BIP39 mnemonic used with Samourai, it is necessary to click on the \"Add Account...\" button and click on the Whirlpool option (the last one). This will add the buttons on the left and will allow us to see the funds and the transactions related to our ordinary wallet (Deposit) and also the funds and the transactions related to Whirlpool (Premix, Postmix and Badbank).</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/71/Selection_204.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"513\" sizes=\"(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)\" srcset=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/71/responsive/Selection_204-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/71/responsive/Selection_204-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/71/responsive/Selection_204-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/71/responsive/Selection_204-lg.png 1024w\"></figure>\n<h3>Final thoughts</h3>\n<p>In this case we can notice how it is important to know how the tools we are using work. So, if some of them stops working, we will always be in control of our funds. It is very important to avoid to rely on centralized solutions or using tools before trying to understand how they work.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><a href=\"https://www.buymeacoffee.com/anubitux\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/71/buybeer.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"256\" height=\"171\" sizes=\"(min-width: 920px) 703px, (min-width: 700px) calc(82vw - 35px), calc(100vw - 81px)\" srcset=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/71/responsive/buybeer-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/71/responsive/buybeer-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/71/responsive/buybeer-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/71/responsive/buybeer-lg.png 1024w\"></figure></a></p>",
