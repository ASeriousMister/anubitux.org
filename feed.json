When creating the private key with the common tools, even when using all the precautions (i.e. using a live working environment like AnuBitux, disabling all the network connections, using a good source o fentropy, etc.), the operator, even if only for a few seconds, is gaining access to a private key related to funds which are not going to belong to him. To avoid it, multisignature wallets ciuld be created, but this solution is not directly and easily available for all the currencies and may also be pretty difficult to use for most of the users.</p>\n<p>As more complex is the solution we use to store cryptocurrencies, as more it is easy to lose access to them.</p>\n<p>To solve this, we developed something called \"<strong>Blind protocol for crypto wallet generation</strong>\". This protocol provides two tools, <a href=\"https://github.com/ASeriousMister/BlindGen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BlindGen</a> and BlindDecode.</p>\n<p>The BlindGen tool allows <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>two user</strong></span> to create half part of the private key, without ever gaining access to the whole private key and then provides a printable paper wallet only containing the public address. The BlindDecode tool allows the users to obtain the whole private key. It is intended to be used only when in need to spend the funds received on the genearted address.</p>\n<h3>OpSec first</h3>\n<p>Before using the tool, it may be a good idea to use the \"Offline\" shortcut from the AnuBitux desktop, in order to disable all the possible connection to external devices and avoid leaking any kind of information. It is also mandatory to use AnuBitux in live mode and not in a virtual machine and to operate in a safe environment.</p>\n<h3>How to use the tool</h3>\n<p>The tool is provided with a very easy to use graphical interface.

If we don't hear anything there may be something not working in the correct way but definetly we have to remember to turn up the volume. The tool tries to help us showing a clear and big message saying \"VolumeUp\".</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/72/MicCheck.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"461\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/72/responsive/MicCheck-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/72/responsive/MicCheck-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/72/responsive/MicCheck-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/72/responsive/MicCheck-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/72/responsive/MicCheck-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/72/responsive/MicCheck-2xl.png 1600w\"></figure>\n<h3>How to use the tool</h3>\n<p>Once we are sure that our hardware is working properly and we took care of our OpSec, we can launch the tool directly from the <em>Wallet Generators</em> menu or typing <em>mic2paper.py</em> in our terminal.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/72/Mic2Paper1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"185\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/72/responsive/Mic2Paper1-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/72/responsive/Mic2Paper1-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/72/responsive/Mic2Paper1-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/72/responsive/Mic2Paper1-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/72/responsive/Mic2Paper1-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/72/responsive/Mic2Paper1-2xl.png 1600w\"></figure>\n<p>Then we only have to confirm that we feel confortable with our hardware and then the tools does all the magic by itself.</p>\n<p>Then we can choose among many different coins which kind of paper wallet we need.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/72/Mic2paper2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"544\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/72/responsive/Mic2paper2-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/72/responsive/Mic2paper2-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/72/responsive/Mic2paper2-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/72/responsive/Mic2paper2-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/72/responsive/Mic2paper2-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/72/responsive/Mic2paper2-2xl.png 1600w\"></figure>\n<p>After this, we can choose if we want a printable pdf.

The outputs of each Whirlpool mix are always identical resulting in every mix having a lot of possible interpretations. Anyone trying to analyze the blockchain and looking at a Whirlpool transaction cannot say for sure which output corresponds to which input. </p>\n<p>Each of the five Whirlpool participants submits 1 input into the transaction. For a mix to start, a minimum of two of these participants must be new entrants to the pool. These new entrants are known as ‘premixers’ and they are required at every Whirlpool mix. Requiring two premixers to trigger a mix ensures that new liquidity forms part of every cycle and prevents the same pool UTXO’s continually mixing with each other.</p>\n<h3>How does a Whirlpool transaction look like?</h3>\n<p>As stated above, a whirlpool transaction requires 5 participants sending 5 identical outputs. Here you can see an example of a <a href=\"https://mempool.space/tx/3795565f9d3b0885f9b702a6a216653afe03d8bf647d4f640afb4227654703c1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Whirlpool transaction</a>.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/71//Whirlpool.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"823\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/71//responsive/Whirlpool-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/71//responsive/Whirlpool-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/71//responsive/Whirlpool-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/71//responsive/Whirlpool-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/71//responsive/Whirlpool-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/71//responsive/Whirlpool-2xl.png 1600w\"></figure>\n<p>As you can see, two addresses are providing bigger inputs, they are the new entrants, providing a little extra-amount to cover transaction fees.</p>\n<h3>Where are the mixed funds?</h3>\n<p>It is very important to point out that Whirlpool works in a totally <strong>non custodial</strong> way. Funds are never sent to third parties, there's only a coordinator server orchestrating the process without knowing which funds belong to each of the involved addresses.</p>\n<p>Among the mixing process, funds are sent to addresses based on the same seed  used to create the BIP39 software wallet you are using. Whirlpool just uses different standards with an offset on the index.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--info\">Remember that a <a href=\"https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/keys/hd-wallets/derivation-paths/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">derivation path</a> is something like m/44’/60’/0’/0/0. it is tellig your hierarchical deterministic wallet to:</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--info\">- start at the master key (m);<br>- use the BIP44 standard (44);<br>- derive keys for Ethereum (60, use 0 for bitcoin);<br>- do not derive a change address (first zero, use 1 for change addresses);<br>- the index of the address (last zero).</p>\n<p>In detail, Whirlpool is using the following <a href=\"https://github.com/Samourai-Wallet/samourai-wallet-android/blob/develop/Guides/Restore%20%26%20Recovery.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">derivation paths</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"auto\">Deposit: <code>m/44'|49'|84'|47'/0'/0'</code></li>\n<li dir=\"auto\">Bad Bank: <code>m/84'/0'/2147483644'</code></li>\n<li dir=\"auto\">Pre Mix: <code>m/84'/0'/2147483645'</code></li>\n<li dir=\"auto\">Post Mix: <code>m/84'/0'/2147483646'</code></li>\n<li dir=\"auto\">Ricochet: <code>m/44'|49'|84'/0'/2147483647'</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>That means that we can always recover all our funds so long as you have the seed.</p>\n<h3>Recover access to the funds</h3>\n<p>Since the Samourai app may not be available anymore, to access funds held through this client it may be possible to use other clients supporting Whirlpool mixes, like <a href=\"https://sparrowwallet.com/docs/mixing-whirlpool.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sparrow wallet</a> (<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20240405202436/https://www.sparrowwallet.com/docs/mixing-whirlpool.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">backup link</a>). If also Sparrow wallet does not work with Whirlpool anymore, it is enough to use it or other fully feathured clients, like <a href=\"https://electrum.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Electrum</a>, manually specifying the desired derivation path in the wallet setup wizard.</p>\n<p>To see the funds used through Whirlpool with Sparrow wallet, when importing a new keystore based on the BIP39 mnemonic used with Samourai, it is necessary to click on the \"Add Account...\" button and click on the Whirlpool option (the last one). This will add the buttons on the left and will allow us to see the funds and the transactions related to our ordinary wallet (Deposit) and also the funds and the transactions related to Whirlpool (Premix, Postmix and Badbank).</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/71/Selection_204.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"513\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/71/responsive/Selection_204-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/71/responsive/Selection_204-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/71/responsive/Selection_204-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/71/responsive/Selection_204-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/71/responsive/Selection_204-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/71/responsive/Selection_204-2xl.png 1600w\"></figure>\n<h3>Final thoughts</h3>\n<p>In this case we can notice how it is important to know how the tools we are using work. So, if some of them stops working, we will always be in control of our funds. It is very important to avoid to rely on centralized solutions or using tools before trying to understand how they work.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><a href=\"https://www.buymeacoffee.com/anubitux\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/71/buybeer.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"256\" height=\"171\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/71/responsive/buybeer-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/71/responsive/buybeer-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/71/responsive/buybeer-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/71/responsive/buybeer-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/71/responsive/buybeer-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/71/responsive/buybeer-2xl.png 1600w\"></figure></a></p>",

So, when we need to use softwares and tools, it is very important to analyze them to avoid the risk to lose our cryotis or to use solutions that are not working in a proper way.</p>\n<p>We are building AnuBitux, first of all, because we need it for personal and professional reasons and, since it could be useful for others, we decided to share it with everyone that could need it.</p>\n<p>Now we decided to make a little step forward, publishing the way we build it and making it completely replicable by creating a dedicated <a href=\"https://github.com/AnuBitux/build\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub repository</a>.</p>\n<p>We have always built AnuBitux in that way, but. before today, we performed some of the steps manually, now it is completely automated and you only need to launch some preparatory command and then you can run the <a href=\"https://github.com/AnuBitux/build/blob/main/anubitux_script.sh\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">anubitux_script</a>.</p>\n<p>If you want to build AnuBitux by yourself, you can follow these easy steps.</p>\n<p>We should start using some Debian based Linux distribution and install the following packages:</p>\n<p><code>sudo apt install live-build squashfs-tools syslinux-common syslinux-utils xorriso isolinux</code></p>\n<p>Then we can create a folder to store all the files that are being created during the building process, like</p>\n<p><code>mkdir distro</code></p>\n<p>Now we can set the parameters of the distro, suing this command</p>\n<p><code>lb config -b iso --cache true --apt-recommends true -a amd64 --binary-images iso --debian-installer live --linux-flavours amd64 --mode debian --debian-installer-gui true --archive-areas \"main contrib non-free\" --security true --win32-loader false --interactive shell --updates true --iso-application anubitux --iso-publisher https://anubitux.org --iso-volume anubitux --memtest none</code></p>\n<p>With this command, we are setting up things like the repositories to use, the architecture and some information about the project.</p>\n<p>Now we need to gain root privileges so that we can start the building process, creating a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">chroot environment</a>:</p>\n<p><code>sudo -s</code></p>\n<p><code>lb build</code></p>\n<p>This may take a while. We will notice it finisched when we'll see (live) written on the left of our command prompt.</p>\n<p>Now we can execute the anubitux_script. We can copy it to our chroot environment after we downloaded it to our main operating system</p>\n<p><code>cp /path/anubitux_script.sh /distro/chroot/</code></p>\n<p>or download it directly into our chroot environment</p>\n<p><code>sudo apt -y install git</code></p>\n<p><code>git clone https://github.com/AnuBitux/build</code></p>\n<p><code>cd build</code></p>\n<p>Now we need to give execution rights to the script and run it:</p>\n<p><code>chmod +x anubitux_script.sh</code></p>\n<p><code>./anubitux_script.sh</code></p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--info\">Before running the script we may want to check the variables at its beginning. They refer to the versions of the tools that are going to be installed. If some tool has received an update, please change the version number in the corresponfing variable. We plan to update the script regularly but it could be useful to do that check to be sure to obtain the last version of all the tools.</p>\n<p>During the execution of the script we only have to provide a password for the anubitux user and accept the license agreement of the Samsung printers' drivers (if you need to use such devices, unless so the printer-drivers-all package is already installed, supporting a lot of different printers).</p>\n<p>When the script ended up, we may perform some further customization, like installing other drivers and tools. We may also want to delete the script since it is not needed anymore. </p>\n<p>Now we only have to type</p>\n<p><code>exit</code></p>\n<p>to start the building process. When the iso creation is completed, we can find the .iso file in the distro folder. To be able to write it on some bootable device, we only need to run this command</p>\n<p><code>isohybrid isoname.iso</code></p>\n<p>Now we are ready to run our personally built AnuBitux.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><a href=\"https://www.buymeacoffee.com/anubitux\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/68/buybeer.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"256\" height=\"171\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/68/responsive/buybeer-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/68/responsive/buybeer-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/68/responsive/buybeer-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/68/responsive/buybeer-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/68/responsive/buybeer-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/68/responsive/buybeer-2xl.png 1600w\"></figure></a></p>\n<p> </p>",

We can see that the client is checking each of our addresses but it is not sending the whole XPUB key or a lot of unnecessary addresses. If it seems to send more addresses than we have ever used, it depends on the default gap limit. This means that Ledger Live continues deriving addresses until it finds 20 unused addresses, so that it should not miss any balance. We can change this value from the \"Experimental features\" tab, setting a \"Custom gap limit\".</p>\n<p>The second rumor we talked about regards the possibility that Ledger Live is sending our seed to the Ledger's servers. To verify this myth, first of all, we exported the packets in a plain text file.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/67/pic4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"557\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/67/responsive/pic4-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/67/responsive/pic4-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/67/responsive/pic4-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/67/responsive/pic4-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/67/responsive/pic4-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/67/responsive/pic4-2xl.png 1600w\"></figure>\n<p>Then we used our <a href=\"https://anubitux.org/search-for-bip39-seeds-with-anubitux/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">seedsearch</a> tool to verify if there is any mnemonic seed among all the transmitted data.

medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\"><i>liquidate</i></span></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\"> the subject of cryptography in such small spaces, since such a vast and complex subject certainly goes beyond the purpose of these articles, I leave ample space for the passion and study of each of us on texts also available online.</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">This concluding article wants us to get to know a little better how a cryptographic method that is very popular and discussed today works: the use of Elliptic-Curve Cryptography in the Bitcoin protocol.</span></span></span></p>\n<h4>Some preliminary information</h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">If we wanted to use a similarity with the traditional credit system, we could think, simplifying to a minimum, that in the Bitcoin system the </span></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\"><strong>public address</strong></span></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\"> represents a sort of Iban code, the </span></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\"><strong>wallet</strong></span></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\"> is the credit institution or a safety deposit box and the </span></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\"><strong>private address</strong></span></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\"> depicts the secret code to access the account or the key used to open the safety deposit box.<br>Choosing a wallet is one of the first operations to be carried out to enter the world of cryptocurrencies and is equivalent to opening a virtual wallet, which acts as a container for one's bitcoin addresses.</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">There are various types of wallets, each with its advantages and disadvantages, depending on whether you want to use it on a computer, smartphone or directly online, in the latter case without installing any program. This first category is known in the jargon as </span></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\"><i>hot wallets</i></span></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">, because it is based on applications that are somehow connected to the internet.<br>Conversely, </span></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\"><i>cold wallets</i></span></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\"> or </span></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\"><i>cold storages</i></span></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\"> are considered much more secure since they are not connected to the internet. This category includes wallets stored on an external mass memory and kept in a safe place, or the so-called </span></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\"><i>hardware wallets</i></span></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">, hardware devices created specifically to store private addresses.</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">Among the cold wallets we can certainly mention the </span></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\"><i>physical bitcoins</i></span></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">, real coins minted in metals of different values, inside which the numerical representation of the private bitcoin address is printed and kept.<br>Finally, one of the methods considered among the safest for storing bitcoin addresses is the </span></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\"><i>paper wallet</i></span></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">, i.e. the simple printing of bitcoin addresses on paper, perhaps even in QR Code format to facilitate their use, to be kept in a safe place.</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">Although the cold wallet category is generally considered more secure, since it is not exposed to any pitfalls deriving from connection to a network, it must be borne in mind that the loss of one of the aforementioned devices results in the almost certain loss of the bitcoins contained in them.</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">All these applications and devices have, as their main purpose, the preservation of bitcoin addresses, in particular the private one on which the existence of both the public address and the bitcoins themselves depend.</span></span></span></p>\n<h4>The Bitcoin protocol</h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">We all know by now that the Bitcoin system is based on the invention of what we can define as the </span></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\"><i>backbone</i></span></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\"> of this protocol, which is the </span></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\"><strong>Blockchain</strong></span></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">.<br>Beyond what the use (and abuse, I would add) of this excellent intuition has become today, it will be necessary to remember that </span></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\"><u>for the Bitcoin system to guarantee secure transactions between users, without the presence of intermediaries who act as guarantors, the creators took advantage of the important developments in cryptography</u></span></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">, especially public-key cryptography.</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">In fact, the first approach to the Bitcoin world takes place with the creation of one's own key pair, the public and the private one, linked together through a one-way cryptographic function called the </span></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\"><strong>Elliptic Curve Digital</strong></span></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\"> </span></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial,

style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\"> and is extremely important in the Bitcoin system, both because the public key is generated from it, and because owning a private key is equivalent to having the bitcoins associated with the relative address available.<br>Therefore, since the private key operates as if it were the only secret code useful

the previous cryptographic elaborations bring considerable advantages both in terms of usability, since they reduce the public address to only 33 alphanumeric characters, and because they integrate

Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">A transaction is basically a passage of bitcoins from one address to another. In order to ensure the highest level of security at all times during this very delicate phase, the Bitcoin system makes extensive use of the cryptographic techniques described in the previous article, such as </span></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\"><i>hashing</i></span></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:

lang=\"en-US\"><i>signature.</i></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">Let's see what happens when we want to transfer some bitcoins from one address to another:</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">When a user A (whom we will call </span></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\"><strong>Sender</strong></span></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">) decides to transfer X number of bitcoins to a user B (whom we will call </span></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\"><strong>Recipient</strong></span></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">) all he has to do is enter the recipient's bitcoin address and the desired amount of bitcoins in the application used as wallet. The software will automatically take care of carrying out a series of operations not directly visible to users, but which are necessary to make the bitcoins transit with extreme security.<br><br>First of all, it must be stated that, simplifying a lot, </span></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\"><u>due to an intrinsic property of the Bitcoin protocol, every time a Sender initiates a transaction, he will use the parts not used in previous transactions (</u></span></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\"><i><u>UTxO</u></i></span></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\"><u> = unspent transaction output)</u></span></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">. All of these parts, used up to the desired amount, will be sent to the Recipient, any part exceeding the amount due will be considered as remainder.</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">In fact, each transaction can be represented as a register divided between inputs, containing all the previous transactions from which the bitcoins of one's address originate, and the outputs where the addresses of the recipients will be indicated, including that of the sender if not all of their bitcoins are used.<br>The output of one transaction will become the input of the next transaction.<br>Normally the input values ​​are greater than the output ones, since the system is structured to recognize a reward, called </span></span></span><span

transactions</i></span></span></span></p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">Each transaction is made up of addresses, amounts, digital signatures and hash values, as well as other data useful for the correct functioning of the system, but in no case are there names or references to the people who are using these bitcoins.<br>For this reason, the Bitcoin system does not allow a direct relationship between real users and the addresses they use, even if we cannot speak of an anonymous transaction system.<br>Each Bitcoin transaction, after being approved, is published in a register, called Blockchain, which is public and unalterable.<br>This means that for each transaction made, there will be an annotation in this register, always visible and available to anyone who wants to consult it.<br>Furthermore, using additional tools, some of which are freely available online, it is possible to obtain a list of all transactions, as well as other useful information, relating to a specific bitcoin address. On this topic I recommend you to read </span></span></span><a

why </span></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\"><strong>the Bitcoin system cannot be considered totally anonymous, but it can be defined as pseudo-anonymous</strong></span></span></span><span style=\"font-family: Arial, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">, since it guarantees an excellent
