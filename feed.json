            "content_html": "<p>When coding with Python, one of the bigger matters we have to deal with its dependencies. With a community as big as Python's one, this problem couldn't remain unsolved! In fact, we can use <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">virtual environments</a>, a solution that allows us to execute every Python script with its own version of the libraries it uses. This helps us to avoid conflicts between scripts needing different versions of the same library or between incompatible libraries.</p>\n<h3>How virtual environments work </h3>\n<p>First of all, we need to install Python virtual environments to be able to use them. To do that we can simply run:</p>\n<p><code>pip3 install venv</code></p>\n<p>Now, when we write a Python script or download some from <a href=\"https://github.com/search?l=Python&amp;q=python&amp;type=Repositories\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub</a>, like one of <a href=\"https://github.com/ASeriousMister\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ours</a>, we can open our Terminal and change the working directory with the path of the tool:</p>\n<p><code>cd /home/anubitux/Tools/python_tool</code></p>\n<p>Now, let's create our virtual environment:</p>\n<p><code>virtualenv demo</code></p>\n<p>This is going to create a python virtual environment named \"demo\", that will be placed in a newly created folder in the tool's directory.</p>\n<p>At this point, we need to activate it, and all the libraries we are going to install will only be used within our virtual environment:</p>\n<p><code>source demo/bin/activate</code></p>\n<p>Now, to be sure our virtual environment is active, we can see its name in brackets on the left of our username in our terminal.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/Selection_055.png\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/responsive/Selection_055-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/responsive/Selection_055-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/responsive/Selection_055-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/responsive/Selection_055-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/responsive/Selection_055-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/responsive/Selection_055-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"venv1\" width=\"900\" height=\"143\"></figure>\n<p>Now we can install our libraries, running</p>\n<p><code>pip3 -r install requirements.txt</code></p>\n<p>if the tool we are going to use has a list of dependencies placed in the conventional <em>requirements.txt</em> file, or simply running</p>\n<p><code>pip3 install python_library_name</code></p>\n<p>When our environment is ready, we can run our tool:</p>\n<p><code>python3 demo_tool.py</code></p>\n<p>If we are done, we can stop our virtual environment running:</p>\n<p><code>deactivate</code></p>\n<p>So the virtual environment's name in brackets will disappear.</p>\n<h3>How Anu₿itux uses virtual environments</h3>\n<p>Anu₿itux uses many different <a href=\"https://anubitux.org/what-is-anubitux/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Python tools</a>, some of them developed by our <a href=\"https://anubitux.org/meet-the-anubitux-project/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">team</a>, some of them developed by other trusted developers. Of course, our users wouldn't feel comfortable activating a different virtual environment every time they need to run a Python tool. So we adopted a solution suggested by our friends from the <a href=\"https://tsurugi-linux.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tsurugi Linux</a> team.</p>\n<p>First of all, we created an environment for every single tool, with the procedure shown above. Then, to make sure that our tool is going to use it without the need to activate it, we placed its directory in the first commented line of every tool. This is the way to specify for every tool where it has to take the libraries it is going to use.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/Selection_056.png\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/responsive/Selection_056-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/responsive/Selection_056-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/responsive/Selection_056-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/responsive/Selection_056-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/responsive/Selection_056-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/responsive/Selection_056-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"comment\" width=\"500\" height=\"109\"></figure>\n<p>in the example, <em>ssve</em> is the name we gave to the virtual environment.</p>\n<p>It is important to indicate <em>python3</em> at the end of the line. This way we will be able to launch the tool without the need to specify it in the Terminal.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--info\">Doing that, it could happen that a python3 file is not available in the virtual environment folder. If so, we can place a <a href=\"https://linuxhint.com/create_symbolic_link_ubuntu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">symbolic link</a> into it pointing to <em>/usr/bin/python3</em>.</p>\n<p>Now, to be able to run the tool without the need to go to its directory, using root privileges we'll add a symbolic link to it in a directory that is included in the $PATH system variable, like <em>/usr/bin</em>. The $PATH system variable controls where our system is going to look for the commands we enter in our Terminal.</p>\n<p><code>sudo ln -s demo_tool.py /usr/bin/</code></p>\n<p>Finally we need to add the execution rights to the symbolic link:</p>\n<p><code>sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/demo_tool.py</code></p>\n<p>Now, after restarting our Terminal, we will be able to run our tools as all the other commands we are used to!</p>\n<h3>Something to pay attention to</h3>\n<p>A lot of python tools do not use only libraries, but also some files placed in their folder. When launching them from our Terminal in any working directory, they won't be able to find those files. To solve this, we need to add a line to our python tool that makes its process run in the correct directory:</p>\n<p><code>os.chdir('path/of/the/tool')</code></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/Selection_057.png\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/responsive/Selection_057-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/responsive/Selection_057-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/responsive/Selection_057-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/responsive/Selection_057-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/responsive/Selection_057-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/19/responsive/Selection_057-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"oschdir\" width=\"450\" height=\"61\"></figure>\n<p> </p>",

These are very sensible operations and doing some mistakes or operating with carelessness could compromise our funds. Cryptocurrencies are great because they let us be our bank, but this also implies that we are responsible for our funds.</p>\n<p>We should also pay attention to the tools we use during our process. We should prefer simple and open-source tools, that we could easily inspect to be sure about how they handle our precious information. </p>",

For example, it could fix a mnemonic seed with both missing and wrong words. It is important that we do not know only the mnemonic seed we are trying to fix but also at least one other piece of information like our extended public key, one or more addresses or the wallet file the seed is related to. We also need to know the correct derivation path used with the mnemonic seed.</p>",

In addition to providing valuable tools that make analysis and investigations easier, they use complex heuristics for clustering and tagging cryptocurrency wallets.</p>\n<h3>How can we investigate the blockchain?</h3>\n<p>Regarding the clustering techniques, we talked about them in <a href=\"https://anubitux.org/clustering-bitcoin-addresses/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this post</a>.</p>\n<p>Suffice it to say that, knowing in depth aspects of Bitcoin such as the format of the addresses and the management of the amounts to be transferred, it is possible to deduce that multiple addresses are associated with the same entity.</p>\n<p>Using clustering techniques and starting from an address whose entity that manages it is known, it will be possible to associate the whole reconstructed cluster with it.</p>\n<h3>How does <em>clustering</em> work</h3>\n<p>Let’s take a look at the following <a href=\"https://www.blockchain.com/en/btc/tx/ff51e4b5dddb4425a34a442710855d36376126313ad89417c004acab85705d4c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">transaction</a>:</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/34/1.png\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/34/responsive/1-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/34/responsive/1-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/34/responsive/1-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/34/responsive/1-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/34/responsive/1-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/34/responsive/1-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"76\"></figure>\n<div>\n<p>If we are aware that the address <a href=\"https://www.blockchain.com/en/btc/address/1KKJ992kekD8KHMhGVLmkGodBPzVaoky88\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">1KKJ992kekD8KHMhGVLmkGodBPzVaoky88</a> belongs to entity A, we can say that also the other sender address belongs to the same entity A. This clustering method is called “co-spending”. It is based on the assumption that to spend the bitcoins of multiple addresses it is necessary to sign the transaction with the private key of each of these. Therefore, whoever arranges the transaction must simultaneously have all the private keys available and it is unreasonable to think that these are in the availability of foreign subjects.</p>\n<p>Knowing the Bitcoin protocol better, especially considering that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>transactions consist in forwarding amounts previously received and not yet spent;</li>\n<li>in transactions, there is generally a change address that receives the part of bitcoin used in the transaction that is not intended to be sent to the recipient and is not intended to be paid as a fee;</li>\n<li>transaction fees are generally determined by the clients used on the basis of the byte weight of the transaction;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>it is possible to associate the cluster also to the address receiving the change of the transaction.</p>\n<p>In fact, in this case, if the purpose of the transaction had been to send 0.00682001 bitcoins to the first address, it would not have made sense to use both amounts to weigh down the transaction. So we can say that the address <a href=\"https://www.blockchain.com/en/btc/address/1GkYDvrGzDCXmnx8P9VTKByWSnrzNfzGQL\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">1GkYDvrGzDCXmnx8P9VTKByWSnrzNfzGQL</a> also belongs to entity A, since it received the change of the transaction.</p>\n<h3>What about tagging?</h3>\n<p>Once we understand how to associate multiple addresses with each other, we need to understand how to link them to a known entity. In addition to using the aforementioned services, we can think of searching online for each address of the cluster using various services such as <a href=\"https://bitcoinwhoswho.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">BitcoinWhosWho</a> or by searching on portals such as <a href=\"https://bitcointalk.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">BitcoinTalk</a> or <a href=\"https://keybase.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Keybase</a>.</p>\n<p>It may happen that these methods give positive results, but often this is not the case. And if you are dealing with entities that are particularly attentive to anonymity such as black markets, it will be even more difficult to find information online. The difficulty increases with the markets created most recently. In fact, it is not unusual to find a lot of information on wallets from past markets, such as <a href=\"https://oxt.me/entity/silk%20road\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Silk Road</a> or <a href=\"https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/AlphaBayMarket\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Alphabay</a>, while for more recent markets, information is scarce.</p>\n<p>To be able to find something useful you can try to stir things up a bit, using a so-called “dust transaction”.</p>\n<h3>Dust transactions</h3>\n<p>These transactions take the form of sending very small amounts of bitcoins to a large number of addresses. Below you can see an <a href=\"https://www.blockchain.com/en/btc/tx/e2d7a80680aa366acfe1cbd0fa8deb1bbb0dd11e62678208aa01c0533d114937\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">example</a>:</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/34/2.png\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/34/responsive/2-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/34/responsive/2-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/34/responsive/2-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/34/responsive/2-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/34/responsive/2-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/34/responsive/2-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"167\"></figure>\n<p>The transaction features over 2700 destination addresses and an amount spent that does not even reach 0.03 bitcoins. If, when the transaction is prepared, the ownership of each address is noted, it will be possible, studying its future activity, to reconnect it to other addresses and perhaps reconstruct at least part of the wallet of the subject we are examining.</p>\n<p>Basically, with a dust transaction, we are creating a starting point for an analysis aimed at the reconstruction of a wallet of interest.</p>\n<p>Such an analysis makes sense if the transaction is directed to addresses that would otherwise not be used or disclosed. Otherwise, if we are dealing with addresses already in use, mere monitoring would be more than enough. Instead, let’s think of services that automatically provide a new address every time they request payments in bitcoin. The addresses generated will still be in the availability of the service, but if they do not receive transactions they will not be used and no further analysis will be possible.</p>\n<h3>A practical case: black markets</h3>\n<p>An analysis of this type may well be applied to a black market, especially those that have an escrow wallet. In practice, those markets keep the balance of each user and reduce it as they make purchases.</p>\n<p>Let’s register a test account on such a market, for example, <a href=\"https://www.darknetstats.com/big-blue-market/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">BigBlueMarket</a> (now offline) and let’s try to top up our available balance.</p>\n<p>From the main page, we see that the balance of the newly created account is zero and that we can click on the appropriate link “deposit funds”.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/34/3.png\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/34/responsive/3-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/34/responsive/3-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/34/responsive/3-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/34/responsive/3-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/34/responsive/3-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/34/responsive/3-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"235\"></figure>\n<p>In this way we will see a new screen, where there is an address associated with our account and towards which we can arrange a transaction. By doing so we will have funds available to make purchases on the market.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/34/4.png\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/34/responsive/4-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/34/responsive/4-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/34/responsive/4-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/34/responsive/4-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/34/responsive/4-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/34/responsive/4-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"294\"></figure>\n<p>We got the address 19t8ESJ6iMWbBMNT1qS5nnHxZT2ijQhWww. By sending bitcoins to it, our balance will automatically be increased. We have to consider that the address is not in our availability, but is managed by the market administrators. As we make purchases, there will be no corresponding transactions starting from the identified address, but only an update of a record in the market’s database. The address will always remain in the exclusive availability of the market administrators. In addition, if there was a direct transaction to the seller’s wallet, this could seriously compromise their anonymity and dissuade them from selling on that particular market. Therefore, to maximize the anonymity of users registered on the platform, it is reasonable that the individual trades are managed off-chain by the market.</p>\n<h3>The advantages of “dust transactions”</h3>\n<p>The activity of the Bitcoin addresses used to top up accounts will not follow a trend that will reflect the actual activity performed on the market. Therefore, it is more than reasonable to think that at some point the administrators will also use the bitcoins of the address we have (hypothetically) reloaded for various reasons.</p>\n<p>If instead of reloading a single address, we send a very small amount of bitcoins to different addresses, it will be very likely that some of these will be used together with other addresses in the market. Thus, little by little, it will be possible to at least partially reconstruct the wallet used by the administrators that manage the market.</p>\n<p>In doing so, we have created various starting points to rediscover the black market's wallet. As soon as the administrators move the funds either for a withdrawal requested by a seller or to withdraw their earnings, they will most likely also use some of the bitcoins present on the addresses we know. By doing so, using this address together with others in a single transaction, we will be able to reconstruct the market wallet a little at a time.</p>\n<p>Holders of the wallet could make a “coin selection” before arranging the transactions and notice the presence of dust transactions, avoiding spending them and compromising their anonymity. However, by carrying out similar transactions to a large number of addresses, relating to different entities of interest, with a negligible expense it could be possible to reconstruct and tag a large number of wallets.</p>\n<h3>Conclusions</h3>\n<p>Dust transactions are one of the methods used to try to find information on cryptocurrency wallets. Clearly, it is a method with several contraindications. In particular:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>it is better to use it only when there are no other viable roads;</li>\n<li>it requires a cost as, albeit small, a Bitcoin transaction must be arranged;</li>\n<li>the target of the investigation could notice the dust transaction and become aware of our interest;</li>\n<li>sending a transaction to the target must be done with due caution so as not to reveal information about us and obtain the opposite effect to that hoped for.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, if used with due care, dust transactions can sometimes give a turning point to investigations that cannot otherwise be resolved, in particular with limited resources or little time available.</p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",

Through a hierarchical-deterministic process, private keys, public keys and public addresses are derived from this sequence of words, but we usually see only our addresses.</p>\n<h3>How could we do that?</h3>\n<p>Let's see an example procedure, carried out with Anu₿itux, to obtain the private key of a specific address, minimizing the risks of handling our mnemonic seed thanks to the fact that we are using a live working environment.</p>\n<p>For example, let's say we are interested in the private key of a specific address that we usually manage with our <a href=\"https://blockstream.com/green/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Blockstream Green Wallet</a>, like the following one.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/Selection_028.png\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/Selection_028-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/Selection_028-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/Selection_028-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/Selection_028-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/Selection_028-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/30/responsive/Selection_028-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"green1\" width=\"800\" height=\"360\"></figure>\n<p>To know the related private key we also need to know our mnemonic seed, in this case: <em>stand tree close slice beauty alert stereo green beauty verify fatal since brown pig impact zone snap measure obtain fun often neither rough elevator.</em></p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--warning\"><em><strong>Handling our mnemonic seeds has always to be considered a very dangerous operation.

            "content_html": "<p class=\"msg msg--warning\"><em><strong>DISCLAIMER</strong>: This post contains some suggestions that could be helpful for law enforcement agencies or security consultants that need to seize cryptocurrencies. It aims to show how Anu₿itux could be used to perform the seizure but is not intended to be exhaustive. It is also recommended to check the local law before proceeding with a cryptocurrency seizure procedure.</em></p>\n<p>Anu₿itux is realized to safeguard users' privacy and provide a very simple environment to manage a lot of aspects regarding cryptos. Of course, it could be used by law enforcement agencies and security consultants to perform crypto seizures.</p>\n<h3>Where?</h3>\n<p>Doing a crypto seizure, the first matter is to obtain a secure place to store cryptocurrencies With Anu₿itux we can create a lot of different kinds of wallets to store coins. One of the best and cheaper ways is to store them with a <a href=\"https://anubitux.org/how-to-generate-random-paper-wallets-with-anubitux/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">paper wallet</a>. In previous posts, we have seen some methods to realize <a href=\"https://anubitux.org/how-to-create-a-paper-wallet-with-anubitux/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bitcoin</a> and <a href=\"https://anubitux.org/how-to-create-a-monero-paper-wallet-with-anubitux/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Monero</a> paper wallets, but these procedures can be adapted also to other currencies. With Anu₿itux we also can print our paper wallets without the need to connect to the Internet and download drivers, since it has a lot of them already installed. </p>\n<p>Once we printed our paper wallet, we also need to take care of where are we going to store it. We should use a sealed container that does not reveal any information, even if exposing it near a strong light or wetting it. We also need to close it in a way that makes it difficult to open and that can reveal if someone accessed it without authorization.</p>\n<p>If we had time to prepare the seizure we could have a hardware wallet to store the currencies we need to size. In this case, we can also use Anu₿itux to manage it, because it integrates clients, drivers and udev rules for many different <a href=\"https://anubitux.org/connecting-your-hardware-wallet-to-anubitux/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hardware wallets</a>, like Ledgers, Trezors, Bitboxes, etc. In this case, it is very important to decide how to handle the mnemonic seed because, even if hardware wallets can be considered very secure, obtaining their seed could give complete control over the handled funds. If we decide to keep the seed, we can consider valid the same considerations we made for paper wallets.</p>\n<p>If we need to perform a Bitcoin seizure, a good way to store the seized coins could be to use an <a href=\"https://opendime.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">OpenDime</a>. It is a special kind of hardware wallet, supporting only Bitcoin, that gives us a public address to send the coins to and that won't reveal the related private key unless we push a pin through the appropriate hole. So, as long as this hole is safe, we can be sure that no human has seen the private key of our address and no one could have spent the funds we sent to the OpenDime's public address.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/17/Selection_027.png\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/17/responsive/Selection_027-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/17/responsive/Selection_027-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/17/responsive/Selection_027-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/17/responsive/Selection_027-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/17/responsive/Selection_027-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/17/responsive/Selection_027-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"opendime\" width=\"600\" height=\"317\"></figure>\n<h3>How?</h3>\n<p>Once we have arranged something to send the coins to, we need to dispose a transaction to accomplish the seizure. We need to remember that the only way for a seizure to be effective is to have the funds on something that is under our control. So we need to be sure that there are no other copies of the wallet that is going to keep the seized coins and that there is a way to guarantee that no one can have access to private keys or seeds. So, we can't consider the funds as seized if we seize a hardware wallet, a device with some kind of wallet installed, or a recovery seed. All these things could have been backed up in a lot of creative ways so, if we don't move funds they could be accessed in many ways and our seizure could be ineffective.</p>\n<p>Moving funds could not be that easy. There are many ways to protect cryptocurrencies from unauthorized uses, like PINs, passwords, passphrases, etc. If the owner of the funds we need to seize is cooperating, we should not encounter any problem disposing the transaction. If not so, we could need to take control of the funds against their will.</p>\n<p>With skilled users, it could be almost impossible, but a lot of users are lazy or do not have a very strong OpSec. So we could do some of the following actions, looking for any information that could be used to take control over the funds:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>try to unlock wallet files with <a href=\"https://anubitux.org/recover-access-to-a-wallet-file-with-anubitux/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">btcrecover</a>, maybe using a custom password list created with credentials extracted from the users' browsers or from their devices or based on their personal information;</li>\n<li>scan directories for mnemonic seeds with <a href=\"https://anubitux.org/search-for-bip39-seeds-with-anubitux/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">seedsearch</a>;</li>\n<li>scan directories for private keys with <a href=\"https://anubitux.org/how-to-find-lost-private-keys-with-anubitux/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">btckeysearch</a>;</li>\n<li>try to unlock encrypted volumes and containers with <a href=\"https://github.com/ASeriousMister/VeraDecrypt.py\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">veradecrypt</a>, maybe using a custom password list created with credentials extracted from the users' browsers or from their devices or based on their personal information;</li>\n<li>perform an accurate house search looking for everything that seems like a mnemonic seed or a private key or any kind of wallet stuff;</li>\n<li>any other creative idea is welcome.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once we obtained the information we need to dispose the transaction, we need to know how to use it. If we have found the password or the PIN to unlock a desktop wallet, we can dispose the transaction from there or we could decide to <a href=\"https://anubitux.org/how-to-sign-a-transaction-offline-with-anubitux/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">dispose it offline</a> to avoid using the user's device. Instead, if we have found mnemonic seeds or private keys, we need to import them to a compatible client. If we don't know how the seeds were used, we can use <a href=\"https://anubitux.org/find-out-how-a-seed-was-used-with-anubitux/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">seedcheck</a> and try to find it out and import it to the right client. Instead, if we have found some <a href=\"https://anubitux.org/how-to-find-lost-private-keys-with-anubitux/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">private keys</a>, we can refer to the procedures shown for <a href=\"https://anubitux.org/how-to-spend-a-paper-wallet-with-anubitux/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bitcoin</a> and <a href=\"https://anubitux.org/how-to-spend-a-monero-paper-wallet-with-anubitux/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Monero</a>.</p>\n<h3>Considerations</h3>\n<p>There are a lot of considerations that can be done when performing this kind of procedure and, as much experience we have, as many useful considerations we will be able to make.</p>\n<p>One of the first considerations we need to make is about the network fees. A higher one could be useful to obtain faster confirmations of our transaction and consider it valid but, if the chosen fee is too high, it could impact too much on the seized amount.</p>\n<p>When the transaction has been disposed, we also need to wait for some confirmations to avoid that someone else could make it invalid with an <a href=\"https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Replace_by_fee\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">RBF</a> (replace by fee) transaction, that is a transaction with a higher fee that could be processed faster and making ours look like a \"double spend\" attempt.</p>\n<p>Other useful considerations could be done when dealing with multi-currency wallets, like <a href=\"https://www.exodus.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Exodus</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coinomi.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Coinomi</a>, <a href=\"https://wallet.mycelium.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MyCellium</a>, <a href=\"https://guarda.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Guarda</a>, <a href=\"https://atomicwallet.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Atomic</a>, etc. First of all, it could be better to arrange a paper wallet for any of the available currencies. We also need to evaluate if the user owns tokens in his wallet that work on layer 2 blockchains, like <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ERC20</a> tokens, <a href=\"https://opensea.io/blog/guides/non-fungible-tokens/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NFTs</a>, etc. These tokens \"live\" on other blockchains and do not have their own so, to move them, we need to pay the fee with the main coin related to the blockchain on which they work. For instance, with tokens like <a href=\"https://basicattentiontoken.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BAT</a> or <a href=\"https://shibatoken.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Shiba Inu</a>, we won't be able to move them without an amount of ETH that we will need to pay gas fees for the Ethereum network. This happens not only with tokens working on the Ethereum network but also with tokens working on networks like <a href=\"https://solscan.io/tokens\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Solana</a>, <a href=\"https://bscscan.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BSC</a>, etc.</p>\n<h3>Final thoughts</h3>\n<p>What we have seen in this post is just a collection of tips that can be useful for those who need to seize cryptocurrencies. Of course, it is a more complex operation that needs a lot of different skills, not only regarding how cryptocurrencies work but also regarding digital forensic techniques, networking, OpSec, etc.</p>\n<p>In this scenario, Anu₿itux tries to provide a simple and safe environment that includes all the tools that could be helpful when performing such tasks.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",

With the proper desktop shortcut, named \"Go offline\", we can also disable the networking features.</p>\n<p>When our paper wallet is ready we can print it. Anu₿itux integrates a lot of ready to use printer drivers, so we will not need to connect to the Internet to download the proper drivers for our printer. If our printer is not supported, it is preferrable to download the proper drivers from a different working environment or to prepare them before starting this procedure.</p>\n<p> </p>",
