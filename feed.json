            "content_html": "<p>Signing a transaction in an offline working environment could be a good idea if we are worried about exposing our private keys online. The only phase in which a transaction needs an internet connection is the broadcast, when it is sent to the network, so, the steps that require the private key can be done locally and offline. This is also the principle on which hardware wallets are based.</p>\n<p>Let's see two methods to do this kind of operation.</p>\n<h3>Method 1: Electrum</h3>\n<p>Electrum is a very simple to use client wallet, but it also integrates advanced features. Let's assume that we need to send a transaction. To sign it offline, we can set-up a <a href=\"https://electrum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/coldstorage.html#create-a-watching-only-version-of-your-wallet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">watch-only wallet</a> with the addresses we want to use in our transactions. This wallet will sync the balances of the addresses with the network, but will not give us the right to send transactions.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--warning\"><strong><em>In this phase we may want to use AnonSurf to preserve our privacy.

            "content_html": "<p>Using Bitcoin, it is important for both those who value their privacy and those who seek to collect information disseminated in the blockchain to know what clustering is and how it works.</p>\n<h3>Basic knowledge</h3>\n<p>Clustering addresses means assuming that they belong to the same owner which could be a person, a firm, a service like an exchange, a darknet market, a payment processor, etc.</p>\n<p>This can be done by knowing how a Bitcoin transaction works. It allows users that have a valid private key to sign transactions that forward any amount that was previously received to an arbitrary address. This implies that it is not possible to spend any desired amount of bitcoin, but only amounts derived summing previously received ones that have not been spent yet. Those amounts are named UTxOs (unspent transaction outputs).</p>\n<p>This seems to be a limit of the Bitcoin protocol, but this apparent issue is quickly solved, allowing users to send bitcoins to more addresses with the same transaction. So, when a user specifies to his client the amount he wants to send, the client chooses enough UTxOs to reach this value, sending the desired amount to the specified recipient address and sending the remaining part to another address (which could be the same sending address or a new address). This last address is called the change address and the amount it receives is named change of the transaction.</p>\n<h3>Let's see an example.</h3>\n<p>Anubis received three transactions, one of 0.5 bitcoins, one of 0.9 bitcoins and one of 0.3 bitcoins. Now, Anubis wants to send 1 bitcoin to Ramses.</p>\n<p>Anubis' wallet will choose UTxOs to reach the amount of 1 bitcoin (some clients spend every time the entire available amount).</p>\n<p>In this case, we can assume that the wallet chooses the amount of 0.9 bitcoins and the amount of 0.3, reaching a sum of 1.2 bitcoins. So, the client is going to create a transaction that sends 1.1 bitcoins to Ramses' address and 0.1 (minus the transaction fees) to another address belonging to Anubis.</p>\n<p>If the UTxOs used by Anubis' wallet were received by the same address, the transaction will show only one sending address. Unless so, we will see more sending addresses. To make the transaction valid, it needs to be signed with the private keys corresponding to all the sending addresses (all belonging to Anubis).</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/27/utxo.drawio-3.png\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/27/responsive/utxo.drawio-3-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/27/responsive/utxo.drawio-3-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/27/responsive/utxo.drawio-3-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/27/responsive/utxo.drawio-3-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/27/responsive/utxo.drawio-3-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/27/responsive/utxo.drawio-3-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"utxo_change\" width=\"800\" height=\"362\"></figure>\n<h3>Let's cluster!</h3>\n<p>With these premises, we can find out some methods that can be used to cluster addresses together. Here there are some clustering techniques, with examples obtained using <a href=\"https://www.blockchain.com/explorer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">blockchain.com</a>'s explorer.</p>\n<h4>Co-spending</h4>\n<p>As stated above, when a transaction shows more input addresses, it means that it has been signed by the private key related to each of the sending addresses. It is technically possible to partially sign a transaction and then let it sign by another person, but it is an absolutely rare circumstance. In this case, it is possible to assume that all the sending addresses belong to the same entity and can be clustered together.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/27/Selection_004.png\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/27/responsive/Selection_004-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/27/responsive/Selection_004-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/27/responsive/Selection_004-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/27/responsive/Selection_004-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/27/responsive/Selection_004-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/27/responsive/Selection_004-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"cospending\" width=\"800\" height=\"295\"></figure>\n<p>Some methods and solutions could give us false results.

In this case, the UTxOs of different users are joined together in the same transactions, making it very difficult to recognize any single flow of coins. This kind of transactions, unlike CoinJoin transactions, is almost impossible to recognize, because they do not have any distinctive feature.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><a href=\"https://samouraiwallet.com/stowaway\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/27/Selection_010.png\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/27/responsive/Selection_010-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/27/responsive/Selection_010-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/27/responsive/Selection_010-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/27/responsive/Selection_010-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/27/responsive/Selection_010-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/27/responsive/Selection_010-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"278\"></figure></a></p>\n<h4>Change address</h4>\n<p>Looking at how change addresses work lets us assume that not only the input addresses can be clustered together, but also the one receiving the change. The only problem could be how to find out which one is receiving the change and which one is the effective recipient address (the one that is receiving the bitcoins that the user wanted to transfer).</p>\n<h5>Amounts</h5>\n<p>First of all we, can look at the transferred amounts. Usually, if an address receives an amount with a very low number of decimal digits, it could be the effective recipient address because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>humans do not like complex numbers;</li>\n<li>it is very unlikely to send an amount with eight decimal digits that would give a change (minus the transaction fees) with only a few decimal digits.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/27/Selection_006.png\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/27/responsive/Selection_006-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/27/responsive/Selection_006-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/27/responsive/Selection_006-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/27/responsive/Selection_006-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/27/responsive/Selection_006-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/27/responsive/Selection_006-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"135\"></figure>\n<p>Considering that some clients choose the UTxOs so that the amount involved in the transactions reaches the amount that the user wants to transfer, the amount that necessarily requires all the involved UTxOs should be the effective recipient address. In the example of Anubis and Ramses, Anubis' client wouldn't have involved both the UTxOs if he intended to send only 0.1 bitcoins, so the address receiving that amount is necessarily the change address.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/27/Selection_007.png\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/27/responsive/Selection_007-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/27/responsive/Selection_007-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/27/responsive/Selection_007-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/27/responsive/Selection_007-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/27/responsive/Selection_007-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/27/responsive/Selection_007-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"144\"></figure>\n<p>Also in the transaction shown in the picture, if the user wanted to send 0.000888 bitcoins, he wouldn't have needed to involve three UTxOs. This rule works pretty well but, nowadays, lots of clients have their optimization algorithms and do not allow users to make coin selection. In some cases, to avoid address reuse, preserve users' privacy or consolidate the amounts, they spend all the available UTxOs of each address that is involved in the transaction. </p>\n<h5>Address types</h5>\n<p>The majority of the Bitcoin wallets usually use addresses of the same type (for example Electrum supports different kinds of addresses only when creating a wallet <a href=\"https://anubitux.org/how-to-spend-a-paper-wallet-with-anubitux/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">importing the private keys</a>). When a transaction is sent to two addresses of different types, the change address is mostly the one in the same format as the sending addresses.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/27/Selection_008.png\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/27/responsive/Selection_008-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/27/responsive/Selection_008-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/27/responsive/Selection_008-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/27/responsive/Selection_008-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/27/responsive/Selection_008-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/27/responsive/Selection_008-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"130\"></figure>\n<h4>Consolidation transactions</h4>\n<p>There is another situation to consider. Some users do not like to have many UTxOs in many addresses or sometimes move funds to cold storages or new wallets. In this case, we'll have a transaction without any change address, because users are moving all of their funds. So all the addresses involved in the transactions (senders and receiver) can be reconducted to the same person. Indeed, it is very unlikely that a user has available different UTxOs whose total amount is exactly what he intended to send including the exact transaction fee.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/27/Selection_009.png\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/27/responsive/Selection_009-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/27/responsive/Selection_009-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/27/responsive/Selection_009-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/27/responsive/Selection_009-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/27/responsive/Selection_009-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/27/responsive/Selection_009-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"179\"></figure>\n<p>We have to be careful with this kind of assertion, because it could also happen that users decide to empty their wallet sending all their coins to an exchange, maybe to convert virtual currency into FIAT currency or to do some trades. So, clustering the recipient address with the sending ones would mean clustering the user's addresses with an address belonging to an exchange. So, we need to observe how the recipient address is being used before clustering it with the sending ones.</p>\n<h3>Final thoughts</h3>\n<p>The mentioned techniques are all based on statistics and the observation of a huge amount of data, so they can mostly be considered valid. Someone that knows very well how Bitcoin works could circumvent these clustering methods, but it is very hard to do it without doing any mistakes. In any case, these techniques work very well in a great part of the cases. We only need to remember that exceptions happen and we have to be ready to question these methods at any time.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",

The tool also checks if the provided seed is compatible with Monero wallets (like <a href=\"https://mymonero.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MyMonero</a>, <a href=\"https://featherwallet.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Feather wallet</a> or <a href=\"https://www.getmonero.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Monero wallet</a>).</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/sc6-2.png\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc6-2-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc6-2-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc6-2-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc6-2-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc6-2-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc6-2-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"513\"></figure>\n<p>As we can see, the tool was able to determinate that the tool was used with Electrum, because the addresses derived with Electrum's algorithms had some activity.</p>\n<p>The tool also find out that the seed could have been derived from a BIP39 wordlist, and checks it with many different coins.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/sc7.png\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc7-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc7-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc7-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc7-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc7-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/11/responsive/sc7-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"sc7\" width=\"650\" height=\"513\"></figure>\n<p>But, in this case, the tool did not find any valid derivation path because no one of the derived addesses was involved in any transaction.</p>\n<p>The tool also works with Monero seeds.

            "content_html": "<p>It is a weird thing but we may forget our wallet's password. Of course, we could use our mnemonic seed to recover it, but there could also be other cases in which we could be looking for a wallet's password. Let's see how we could recover access to the wallet with Anu₿itux, using <a href=\"https://btcrecover.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">btcrecover</a>.</p>\n<h3>What is btcrecover?</h3>\n<p>In Anu₿itux, we can find btcrecover in the Anu₿itux menu, under the \"Recovery\" section. This will show only a hint about how to use it because it has no user interface and needs to be run in our command line. It is a very powerful python tool that gives us a lot of different solutions to recover access to our wallets. It works with wallet files of many different clients (like Electrum, BitcoinCore, Coinomi, MetaMask, etc.), encrypted private keys, bip39 seeds with a passphrase, and more. <a href=\"https://btcrecover.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Usage_Examples/basic_password_recoveries/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Here</a> you can find the official documentation about its password recovery features.  </p>\n<h3>How to use it with Anu₿itux</h3>\n<p>Let's assume we have a wallet file we do not remember the password. First of all, we need to prepare a list of passwords we want to try. We can do it by writing a list of possible passwords, using a prepared <a href=\"https://www.hacktoday.com/password-cracking-dictionarys-download-for-free/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">dictionary</a>, exporting passwords from other available sources like mobiles, browsers, password managers, etc.</p>\n<p>For our purpose we are using a small custom list, just to test how the tool works and a prepared Electrum wallet file. Electrum wallet files can usually be found in the /home/anubitux/.electrum/wallets directory. Notice that with Linux operating systems folders and files whose name starts with \".\" are hidden and may not be shown if the specific option is disabled.</p>\n<p>It can be useful to place a copy of the wallet file we are trying to unlock in a separate folder, to avoid any accidental malfunction and risk to corrupt the original copy of the file. In our case, it is placed in the Documents folder.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/9/btcrec1.png\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/9/responsive/btcrec1-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/9/responsive/btcrec1-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/9/responsive/btcrec1-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/9/responsive/btcrec1-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/9/responsive/btcrec1-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/9/responsive/btcrec1-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"btcrec1\" width=\"800\" height=\"511\"></figure>\n<p>Now let's try to unlock the wallet file running btcrecover. We have to use the --wallet option to indicate the path to the wallet file and --passwordlist to indicate the text file containing the passwords we want to try.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/9/btcr2.png\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/9/responsive/btcr2-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/9/responsive/btcr2-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/9/responsive/btcr2-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/9/responsive/btcr2-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/9/responsive/btcr2-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/9/responsive/btcr2-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"btcr2\" width=\"800\" height=\"520\"></figure>\n<p class=\"msg msg--success\">We could also use shorter paths to file, like \"<em>Documents/wallet_to_recover</em>\". So the command would be: <em>btcrecover.py --wallet Documents/wallet_to_recover --passwordlist Documents/list</em>. We could also move to the directory containing the files we need, using the <em>cd</em> command, and run the tool from there.</p>\n<p>Now clicking Enter, the tool is going to load the password list and identify the kind of wallet file. Then it will start trying all the words until it finds the right one.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/9/btcr3.png\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/9/responsive/btcr3-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/9/responsive/btcr3-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/9/responsive/btcr3-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/9/responsive/btcr3-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/9/responsive/btcr3-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/9/responsive/btcr3-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"btcr3\" width=\"800\" height=\"510\"></figure>\n<p>As we can see in the picture, the tool found the correct password in a few seconds, even because in this case we were trying only a list of eight words and the fifth was the correct one.</p>\n<h3>Some advice</h3>\n<p>As it is possible to see in the output of the tool, in the first stage it loads the whole file containing the password list. If we are attempting to brute-force a wallet with a big dictionary, it could saturate the RAM causing running issues in the whole running system. To avoid this kind of issue, it could be a good idea to split the text file into multiple smaller files. We can do that with the split command, like in the following examples:</p>\n<p><code>split -l 10000 whole_list partial_list</code></p>\n<p>This will create a set of files, which name starts with \"partial_list\", each one containing 10000 lines.</p>\n<p><code>split -b 100M whole_list partial_list</code></p>\n<p>This will create a set of files, which name starts with \"partial_list\", each one with a size of 100 MB.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",

It is obtained by processing the content of a file through a specific cryptographic algorithm. This will return a string of fixed length, the hash value:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>it will be the same every time it is calculated on files with the same content;</li>\n<li>it is not reversible;</li>\n<li>changing only a single detail of the content of the examined file will give a completely different hash value.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How to calculate the hash value</h3>\n<p>There are different methods to calculate hash values, also depending on the operating system you are using.</p>\n<h4>Linux</h4>\n<p>Under Linux, to calculate the hash values, simply use your terminal, change the working directory with the one where the file you want to calculate the hash value is stored with, for example</p>\n<p><code>cd Downloads</code></p>\n<p>then simply use</p>\n<p><code>md5sum Anubitux_2022_1_live.iso</code></p>\n<p><code>sha1sum Anubitux_2022_1_live.iso</code></p>\n<p>The commands will print the hash values in your command line. Compare them with the ones shown in the Anu₿itux download page to be sure you have downloaded the correct file.</p>\n<h4>Windows</h4>\n<p>Under Windows, the best way to check hash values is using some tools like <a href=\"https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/hash_my_files.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">HashMyFiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.quickhash-gui.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">QuickHash</a>, <a href=\"https://gtkhash.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GTKhash</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/namazso/OpenHashTab\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">OpenHashTab</a> or <a href=\"https://www.binaryfortress.com/HashTools/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">HashTools</a>.</p>\n<p>These are all very simple to use GUI tools.</p>\n<p>When done, always compare the obtained hash values with the ones shown on the Anu₿itux download page to be sure you have downloaded the correct file.</p>\n<h4>MacOS</h4>\n<p>Under MacOS, to calculate the hash values, simply use your terminal and change the working directory with the one where the file you want to calculate the hash value is stored, for example</p>\n<p><code>cd Downloads</code></p>\n<p>then simply use</p>\n<p><code>md5 Anubitux_2022_1_live.iso</code></p>\n<p><code>sha1 Anubitux_2022_1_live.iso</code></p>\n<p>The commands will print the hash values in your command line. Compare them with the ones shown on the Anu₿itux download page to be sure you have downloaded the correct file.</p>\n<h3>How to be sure about hash values?</h3>\n<p>Hash values shown on the Anu₿itux <a href=\"https://anubitux.org/download-anubitux/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">download page</a> have been signed with PGP. To be sure that the displayed hash values are correct, you can check the PGP signature. To do so, first of all, download our PGP key from the proposed sources: <a href=\"https://github.com/ASeriousMister/Anubitux-PGP\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">github</a> or <a href=\"https://pastebin.com/bqmy9y2P\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pastebin</a>.</p>\n<p>Then import it to a PGP client like <a href=\"https://www.openpgp.org/software/kleopatra/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kleopatra</a>. To do that simply drag and drop the .asc file into its interface or copy the key content in your clipboard and, in Kleopatra, go to \"Tools\" -&gt; \"Clipboard\" -&gt; \"Certificate import\".</p>\n<p>You may need to certify the key to use it properly. To do so right click on it and select \"Certify\".</p>\n<p>Then open Kleopatra's notepad, like in the following picture:</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/20/Kleopatra_001.png\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/20/responsive/Kleopatra_001-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/20/responsive/Kleopatra_001-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/20/responsive/Kleopatra_001-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/20/responsive/Kleopatra_001-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/20/responsive/Kleopatra_001-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/20/responsive/Kleopatra_001-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"pgp2\" width=\"800\" height=\"480\"></figure>\n<p>Now copy and paste the part of the Anu₿itux <a href=\"https://anubitux.org/download-anubitux/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">download page</a> containing the hash values and the PGP signature.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/20/Kleopatra_002.png\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/20/responsive/Kleopatra_002-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/20/responsive/Kleopatra_002-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/20/responsive/Kleopatra_002-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/20/responsive/Kleopatra_002-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/20/responsive/Kleopatra_002-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/20/responsive/Kleopatra_002-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"pgp2\" width=\"800\" height=\"480\"></figure>\n<p>Now click on \"Decrypt / Verify Notepad\" and, if everithing is okay, you shoul see a message similar to the following one.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/20/Kleopatra_003.png\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/20/responsive/Kleopatra_003-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/20/responsive/Kleopatra_003-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/20/responsive/Kleopatra_003-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/20/responsive/Kleopatra_003-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/20/responsive/Kleopatra_003-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/20/responsive/Kleopatra_003-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"pgp4\" width=\"800\" height=\"480\"></figure>\n<p>Following these steps, you will be sure that the downloaded file corresponds to the original version of Anu₿itux because its hash value corresponds to the one shown on the download page and the message on the download page has not been altered because it has a valid PGP signature.</p>",
