It could be very useful to be able to monitor our addresses, not only to see how we are getting to the moon but also to be sure that our funds are safe and our cold storage is working properly. To do that, of course, we could take note of our public addresses and check them periodically on some block explorer. We can find a lot of them in Firefox's bookmarks in Anu₿itux. To perform this task in a better way, we could arrange a view-only wallet, a wallet that is only able to see what's going on with our addresses but does not know our private keys so that it will be unable to sign transactions and spend our funds.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--warning\"><strong>Never send or request funds to addresses that are in our view-only wallets if we are not sure to be able to access the corresponding private keys!</strong></p>\n<h3>Bitcoin watching-only wallet</h3>\n<p>With Bitcoin addresses, one of the best tools to arrange a watching-only wallet is <a href=\"https://electrum.org/#home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Electrum</a>.

They use other's nodes to check our balances. If available, we should set up our clients to connect only to trusted nodes (we will discuss it in further posts, keep following us).</p>\n<h4>Public addresses</h4>\n<p>In the first case, let's hypothesize we took note of our public addresses and would like to monitor them comfortably through Electrum. To do that let's start Electrum from the Wallets menu in Anu₿itux and create a new wallet, selecting the \"Import Bitcoin addresses or private keys\" option.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/Selection_086.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"425\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_086-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_086-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_086-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_086-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_086-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_086-2xl.png 1600w\"></figure>\n<p>In the next step, we can type or paste our public addresses in the proper box.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/Selection_087.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"431\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_087-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_087-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_087-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_087-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_087-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_087-2xl.png 1600w\"></figure>\n<p>Now, clicking on next, we can provide a password and then we will have our watching-only wallet.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/Selection_088.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"404\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_088-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_088-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_088-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_088-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_088-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_088-2xl.png 1600w\"></figure>\n<h4>Electrum Master Public Key</h4>\n<p>If we created our seed using Electrum, maybe using the advanced feature to obtain a <a href=\"https://anubitux.org/how-to-generate-24-words-mnemonic-seeds-with-electrum/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">24 words mnemonic seed phrase</a>, we could obtain our master public key and use it to set up a new watching-only wallet. Using master keys allows us to create hierarchical deterministic (HD) watching-only wallets. With this kind of wallet, we are able to obtain all the same addresses that we could obtain in our main wallet, related to our mnemonic seed. It could also be very useful if we want to be able to receive transactions on many different public addresses, obtaining them without the need to access our cold storage and keep our private keys safe.</p>\n<p>To obtain our master public key, we only have to go to the Wallet menu and click on Information.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/Selection_089.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"350\" height=\"313\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_089-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_089-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_089-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_089-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_089-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_089-2xl.png 1600w\"></figure>\n<p>In the next window we will see a lot of information about our wallet, like our Master Public Key.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/Selection_090.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"515\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_090-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_090-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_090-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_090-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_090-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_090-2xl.png 1600w\"></figure>\n<p>Let's take note of it and let's create a new Standard wallet.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight  msg--info\">OPSEC TIP: It could be a good idea to access our wallet only in Anu₿itux live and offline, extract our Master Public Key and use it to create our watching-only wallet in a separate working environment that we will connect to the Internet.</p>\n<p>In the second step of the creation wizard, we have to choose the \"Use a Master Key\" option.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/Selection_091.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"428\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_091-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_091-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_091-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_091-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_091-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_091-2xl.png 1600w\"></figure>\n<p>Now we only have to type or paste the Master Public Key and we have set up our watch-only wallet. </p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/Selection_092.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"434\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_092-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_092-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_092-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_092-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_092-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_092-2xl.png 1600w\"></figure>\n<p>As we can see in the following screenshot, we obtained the same addresses in both wallets, with the difference that only one of them would be able to spend the funds we could receive.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/Selection_093.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"379\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_093-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_093-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_093-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_093-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_093-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/45/responsive/Selection_093-2xl.png 1600w\"></figure>\n<h4>Master Public Key</h4>\n<p>Let's now hypothesize we want to create a watch-only wallet related to a BIP39 seed.

It is a very useful feature of many software wallets that we should consider if we are not doing transactions on a regular basis. We only have to remember that obtaining master public keys implies that we are handling our private keys or our seed and this operation has to be done very carefully, to avoid any risk concerning the safety of our funds.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",

We believe that there is no universal solution, but only a lot of different solutions that fit the needs of one user or another.</p>\n<p>A good strategy could be to hide our mnemonic seed with steganography. For those who do not know what it is, steganography is the practice of representing a piece of information within another object in a way that could not be easily seen by others. So we could try to hide our mnemonic seed in another file, like a picture or a video. Let's see how we could do it with Anu₿itux.</p>\n<h3>The procedure</h3>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight \"><strong>To safeguard the security of this process, we kindly suggest following all these steps using Anu₿itux live without connecting it to the internet and disabling all the network interfaces with the proper desktop shortcut.</strong></p>\n<p>First of all, we need a mnemonic seed to hide.

Rather, it is the first step of a journey that will serve to become familiar with some very popular terms and concepts.<br>Perhaps it will help us better understand what is under the hood of some procedures that we now take for granted, which we carry out with mechanical gestures, such as electronic signatures.</p>\n<p>The book “ <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Code-Book-Science-Secrecy-Cryptography/dp/0385495323/ref=sr_1_2?crid=3FELF5VGDR3VG&amp;keywords=simon+singh&amp;qid=1669827671&amp;sprefix=simon+sing%2Caps%2C195&amp;sr=8-2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography</a>\" by Simon Singh was a great source of inspiration for me and a stimulus to delve into these topics. I think it is an exciting starting point for all those who approach this subject, even if only out of pure curiosity.</p>\n<p>Men have always had the need to be able to send communications that were understandable only to the people for whom they were intended. At the same time other men tried to understand its meaning, thus starting the perennial competition between inventors and code solvers.</p>\n<p>This need for confidentiality in communications reached such a level of importance that it was soon seen fit to create an appropriate branch of science, cryptography. On the other hand, cryptanalysis is the discipline that studies the methods for restoring the plain text, starting from the encrypted message without knowing the key.</p>\n<h3>The first methods to hide a message</h3>\n<p>In the Bible we can observe one of the oldest ancient cryptographic methods. In the book of Jeremiah, in fact, some words have been replaced by others (Babel has been transcribed with the word Sheshakh) using a monoalphabetic <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">substitution cipher</a> called Atbash, in which the first letter of the alphabet is replaced by the last, the second by penultimate and so on, until obtaining an inverted alphabet.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/47//1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"330\" height=\"538\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/47//responsive/1-xs.jpg 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/47//responsive/1-sm.jpg 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/47//responsive/1-md.jpg 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/47//responsive/1-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/47//responsive/1-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/47//responsive/1-2xl.jpg 1600w\">\n<figcaption >First example of steganography according to Herodotus' account, 480 BC</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Among the first authors to narrate examples of cryptography we find the historian Herodotus who, in his Histories dedicated to the wars between the Greeks and the Persians in the fifth century BC, states that it was the secret writing that saved Greece from Xerxes, king of the Persians. He tells of an episode in which, to get a message to Leonidas (king of the Greeks) who then decreed the victory of the Greeks over the Persians, the wax was scraped off a writing tablet and the message was engraved on the underlying wood, covering the tablet again with wax. This trick turns out to be one of the first examples of steganography known to date, a technique considered the ancestor of cryptography since, as the etymology of the word itself suggests, it serves to cover and not to encode a message (from the Greek steganós = covered and gráphein = to write).</p>\n<p>Methods to hide messages were also studied and adopted in the Asian continent. In particular, in China, the message to be transmitted was painted on strips of silk. These strips, rolled up, were covered in wax and ingested by the messenger. Once at its destination, the message was recovered with techniques that I prefer not to imagine. They were probably the first \"ovulators\", at present famous for transporting another type of goods :-).</p>\n<p>Over the following centuries, almost all civilizations have adopted methods and stratagems to conceal and make it difficult to decipher the messages deemed important. This system, albeit very ingenious, had the major limitation of leaving the message unencrypted, even if covered up.</p>\n<p>An important step forward in this virtual battlefield was the development of cryptography (from the Greek kryptós = hidden), going from hiding the message by concealing it in the most disparate ways so as not to let it be found by anyone who was not the recipient, to hiding the meaning of the message, encrypting it with alterations agreed with the recipient, who only had to reverse the procedure, obtaining the original text.<br>Encryption can be done in two ways: by substitution and by transposition.</p>\n<p>In substitution cryptography it is necessary to swap each letter of the alphabet with another, shifting the alphabet by a constant number of positions. With this method the position of the letters within the alphabet always remains the standard one, both in the original message and in the one used for encryption.</p>\n<p>One of the first and most famous examples of this encryption method was the so-called Caesar Cipher, the use of which by Julius Caesar himself was narrated in his De bello gallico.</p>\n<p>Transposition encryption, on the other hand, causes the letters of the original message to swap places with each other, effectively forming an anagram. To increase the security of this method, it should be used on long enough messages.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, if in substitution encryption each character of the original message is simply shifted by a predetermined number of positions, always retaining its original place within the alphabet, in transposition encryption each letter represents itself, but is placed in a different position, mixing the letters and thus forming a large anagram of the sentence.</p>\n<p>Over the centuries it has been seen that these methods were rather weak, also because of the birth of cryptanalysis, a science born of Arab civilization in the Middle Ages which set itself the goal of interpreting messages without knowing the relative keys.</p>\n<p>One of the pioneers of what would later become a real scientific discipline was a scientist of Arab origins (not surprisingly!), <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Kindi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Abū Yūsuf Yaʿqūb ibn Isḥāq al-Kindī</a>, known as Al-Kindi. In addition to being a philosopher and having had the merit of importing the thoughts of the great Greek philosophers into the Arab world, he was the first to devise a method which made it possible to decipher a text by analyzing the frequencies of the letters used, laying the foundations for creating frequency analysis cryptanalysis.</p>\n<p>All this has led, over time, to the search for increasingly complex methods in order to make the job of deciphering messages more difficult.</p>\n<p>The history of cryptography has seen artistic personalities of the caliber of Leon Battista Alberti at its service, who used two cipher alphabets for the first time, or Blaise de Vigenère who, with his <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Vigenère Table</a>, adopted 26 cipher alphabets, laying the foundations for modern encryption systems.</p>\n<p>With the invention of the radio, by Guglielmo Marconi in 1894, people began to think about remote communication and, of course, to apply message encryption techniques, especially in the military sphere. Given the simplicity and speed of communication of texts via radio waves, efforts to create ever more complex encryption methods increased and parallel attempts at decryption intensified.</p>\n<p>Since it was above all during the world wars that these coded messages assumed extreme importance, a battle within a battle was created: if on the one hand traditional weapons were used to gain positions in the enemy camp, on the other front the weapons were represented by numbers, spaces and letters. One of the first radio encryption methods was invented by the Germans and was called <a href=\"https://crypto.interactive-maths.com/adfgvx-cipher.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ADFGVX</a>.</p>\n<p>Subsequently, in an attempt to create an inviolable system, an American engineer and mathematician, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Claude Shannon</a>, adapted Vigenère 's system, however introducing the concept of a random key, inserted into a sheet filled with random letters which, with hundreds of other similar sheets, formed a block, an identical copy of which would be used by both the sender and the recipient: hence the name of single- use block cipher (= one-time pad cipher), considered the Holy Grail of cryptography since it was many years an absolutely safe method.</p>\n<h3>The cipher machines</h3>\n<figure ><figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/47/2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"273\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/47/responsive/2-xs.jpg 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/47/responsive/2-sm.jpg 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/47/responsive/2-md.jpg 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/47/responsive/2-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/47/responsive/2-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/47/responsive/2-2xl.jpg 1600w\"></figure>\n<figcaption >CaptioEnigma cipher machinen</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>At the end of this brief historical review of cryptographic methods, certainly not exhaustive, we cannot fail to mention the Enigma cipher machine, conceived by the German inventor Scherbius and adopted by the military forces of the Reich. This ingenious device, in the shape of a typewriter, made it possible to type the message (in the clear text) on the keys and to see the encrypted text appear on a viewer which lit up the letters corresponding to the already encrypted message. The main invention of this machine was located inside, where 2 or 3 rotating exchangers were placed which, with each pressure of the keys, rotated by one position thus providing a very high possibility of combinations.</p>\n<p>We could imagine a hypothetical operator sitting in front of this cipher machine, pressing the keys on the letters of the keyboard of the Enigma machine reporting the message to be sent (in clear text). After pressing the key, the electrical impulse crossed the rotors following a path defined by the position of the same and returned back thanks to a reflector, always crossing the rotors. Following this path, the impulse illuminated the light of the letter resulting from the encryption on a special viewer, which the operator then proceeded to transcribe. With each further press of the keys the rotors rotated one position at a time (there were 26 for each rotor, at the end of the revolution of the first rotor, the second would move one position and so on) allowing so the operator to use a polyalphabetic substitution cipher. Since this system could also be used to decrypt messages received with the same system, it was essential to position the rotors of the sending and receiving machines in the same position. This was made possible by means of a register of the daily positions of the rotors distributed to all the units used, through which each operator could have adjusted their rotors based on what was reported in the same, it was a sort of daily calendar of the positions to be applied.</p>\n<p>It was thanks to the efforts of Polish analysts in the first place and then a brilliant team of English cryptanalysts that the German messages were deciphered.</p>\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GCHQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Government School of Codes and Digits</a>, established in Bletchley Park in England, the brightest minds of England were recruited to solve the puzzle called Enigma.</p>\n<figure ><figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/47/3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"490\" height=\"740\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/47/responsive/3-xs.jpg 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/47/responsive/3-sm.jpg 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/47/responsive/3-md.jpg 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/47/responsive/3-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/47/responsive/3-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/47/responsive/3-2xl.jpg 1600w\"></figure>\n<figcaption >Turing bomb</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>The intuition of the young mathematician Alan Turing was decisive in this dispute.</p>\n<p>Based on his studies concerning a programmable universal logic machine, called Turing machine, he had a calculator built, called Bomb, which was able to quickly determine the initial positions of the rotors of the Enigma machine, thus allowing the decipherment of the entire message. On the subject, in addition to countless books, ranging from historical accounts to science fiction, we like to point out the beautiful film <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Imitation_Game\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Imitation Game</a>.</p>\n<p>A few years later, in Bletchley Park, in order to decipher the messages of the German cipher device Lorenz SZ40/42, which represented the evolution of the Enigma machine, the mathematician <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Newman#cite_note-frs-3,\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Newman</a>, always starting from Turing's studies on the universal machine, built the Colossus calculator, which was not only decisive in decrypting thousands of messages considered indecipherable at the time, but represents the first example of a programmable computer in the history of information technology, laying the foundations for the creation of modern electronic computers.</p>\n<p>These exceptional facts have remained unknown for many years, due to the secrecy imposed by the British government, which forced all the protagonists to absolute secrecy and ordered the destruction of the electronic calculators built.</p>\n<h5 class=\"align-center\"><em>Part two coming soon...</em></h5>\n<p> </p>",

A good strategy could be to store most of the funds on cold storages that we keep offline unless we need them and have some funds on hot wallets that we use with clients like Electrum, MyCrypto, Feather, Coinomi, etc. We could have our wallet files on an encrypted USB storage and plug it in when we need to access our funds.</p>\n<p>To manage encrypted storages, Anu₿itux integrates <a href=\"https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Home.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">VeraCrypt</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/mhogomchungu/zuluCrypt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ZuluCrypt</a> (supporting lots of different encryption standards, like <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LUKS</a>, VeraCrypt, <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/it-it/windows/security/information-protection/bitlocker/bitlocker-overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BitLocker</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueCrypt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TrueCrypt</a>).</p>\n<p>We described how to use VeraCrypt in a previous <a href=\"https://anubitux.org/create-encrypted-volumes-with-veracrypt/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">post</a>. VeraCrypt is a very powerful tool to manage encrypted volumes that works across almost all the desktop operating systems.

So, using it, we could be able to decrypt almost all the containers and the storages we have encrypted with other tools or using other operating systems and access the files we need while using Anu₿itux.</p>\n<p>To use ZuluCrypt to access encrypted storages, we simply run its GUI from the Anu₿itux menu, provide the root password (which is set to anubitux when using Anu₿itux live or VM), click on the \"Open\" menu and choose the option that fits your needs.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/40/Selection_072.png\" alt=\"zulu1\" width=\"750\" height=\"442\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/40/responsive/Selection_072-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/40/responsive/Selection_072-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/40/responsive/Selection_072-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/40/responsive/Selection_072-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/40/responsive/Selection_072-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/40/responsive/Selection_072-2xl.png 1600w\"></figure>\n<p>In the next window, we can select the volume or the container we want to decrypt, choose its format and provide the information to unlock it, like password, PIM, keyfile, etc.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/40/Selection_073.png\" alt=\"zulu2\" width=\"750\" height=\"432\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/40/responsive/Selection_073-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/40/responsive/Selection_073-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/40/responsive/Selection_073-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/40/responsive/Selection_073-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/40/responsive/Selection_073-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/40/responsive/Selection_073-2xl.png 1600w\"></figure>\n<p>At this point we only have to click the \"Open\" button and, if we provided the correct credentials, we can access the encrypted files we need from our file manager.</p>\n<p>When we finished our work, we do not have to forget to dismount the volume.

The PIM (personal iterations multiplier) is a number that will be used in addition to our password to encrypt the storage and will be necessary to decrypt it. It adds another layer of security to our drive and reduces the chances to unlock it with brute force attacks. When using shorter passwords than 20 characters, PIM's value can't be lower than 485.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/Selection_068.png\" alt=\"PIM\" width=\"800\" height=\"511\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_068-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_068-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_068-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_068-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_068-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Selection_068-2xl.png 1600w\"></figure>\n<p>We could also add a Keyfile, a file that we have to provide when we want to unlock our volume. We should use this feature when we are unlocking our device only from a few computers because it would force us to carry the file with us on an unencrypted storage in any place we will need to unlock our encrypted storage. Also when working with live environments like Anu₿itux, it would force us to retrieve the file from another source any time we need to unlock our device.</p>\n<p>In the last step, we can choose the Filesystem of our device. We can also choose to use the \"Quick Format\" option. It should be used only with new devices because it will not overwrite all the memory portions of them and could allow someone to recover some information that was stored previously.

After starting the tool, we have to choose a location to mount the volume from the list of numbers. Then we have to click on the \"Select file...\" button if we want to mount a container or on the \"Select Device...\" button if we want to mount an encrypted storage.</p>\n<p>Then we have to click on the Mount button, provide the password and the PIM (if we set it up when creating the volume) and all is done.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/Screenshot_20221126_183645.png\" alt=\"veracrypt_mount\" width=\"600\" height=\"680\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Screenshot_20221126_183645-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Screenshot_20221126_183645-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Screenshot_20221126_183645-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Screenshot_20221126_183645-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Screenshot_20221126_183645-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Screenshot_20221126_183645-2xl.png 1600w\"></figure>\n<p>Now can access our volume with our file manager, like a common external device.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/Screenshot_20221126_183812.png\" alt=\"volume\" width=\"1000\" height=\"576\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Screenshot_20221126_183812-xs.png 300w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Screenshot_20221126_183812-sm.png 480w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Screenshot_20221126_183812-md.png 768w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Screenshot_20221126_183812-lg.png 1024w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Screenshot_20221126_183812-xl.png 1360w ,https://anubitux.org/media/posts/41/responsive/Screenshot_20221126_183812-2xl.png 1600w\"></figure>\n<p class=\"msg msg--info\">When we do not need the volume anymore, we should always dismount it from the VeraCrypt user interface, using the proper button. </p>\n<h3>Final thoughts</h3>\n<p>Veracrypt gives us a safe way to store information and files and access them from almost any desktop operating system. We have always to consider that adding security to our information requires a bigger caution from our side since if we lose or forget the encryption password or the PIM we have set up, it could be impossible to <a href=\"https://anubitux.org/try-to-unlock-a-veracrypt-volume-with-anubitux/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">recover our information</a>. So it is recommended to use passwords we can always remember or we can always access in a safe way.</p>",
